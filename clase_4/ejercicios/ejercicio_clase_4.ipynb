Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago. NASA didn\\'t authorise Selvig to go to test phase. He wasn\\'t testing it. He wasn\\'t even in the room. Spontaneous event. It just turned itself on? Where are the energy levels now? Climbing. When Selvig couldn\\'t shut it down, we ordered evac. How long to get everyone out? Campus should be clear in the next half-hour. Do better. Sir, evacuation may be futile. We should tell them to go back to sleep? If we can\\'t control the Tesseract\\'s energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance. I need you to make sure the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out. Sir, is that really a priority right now? Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone. Yes, sir. With me. Talk to me, Doctor. Director. Is there anything we know for certain? The Tesseract is misbehaving. - Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it\\'s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she\\'s behaving. I assume you pulled the plug. She\\'s an energy source. We turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level... We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space. But we don\\'t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. And she\\'s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation. That can be harmful. Where\\'s Agent Barton? The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual. Agent Barton, report. I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Well, I see better from a distance. Have you seen anything that might set this thing off? Doctor, it\\'s spiking again. No one\\'s come or gone. And Selvig\\'s clean. No contacts, no IMs. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn\\'t at this end. \"At this end\"? Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides. Not yet. Sir, please put down the spear. You have heart. Please don\\'t. I still need that. This doesn\\'t have to get any messier. Of course it does. I\\'ve come too far for anything else. I am Loki, of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose. Loki, brother of Thor. We have no quarrel with your people. An ant has no quarrel with a boot. Are you planning to step on us? I come with glad tidings of a world made free. Free from what? Freedom. Freedom is life\\'s great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart, you will know peace. Yeah, you say \"peace,\" I kind of think you mean the other thing. Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. Like the pharaohs of old. He\\'s right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. We\\'ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical. Well, then. I need these vehicles. - Who\\'s that? - They didn\\'t tell me. Hill! Do you copy? Barton has turned. They have the Tesseract! Shut them down! Okay, let\\'s go. No, leave it. Go! We\\'re clear upstairs, sir. You need to go. Director? Director Fury, do you copy? The Tesseract is with a hostile force. I have men down. Hill? A lot of men still under. I don\\'t know how many survivors. Sound a general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase. Roger that. Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war. What do we do? This is not how I wanted this evening to go. I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me this is better. Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes? Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo? I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business. Solohob a bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow and she turns out to be simply another pretty face. You really think I\\'m pretty? Tell Lermentov we don\\'t need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well... ...you may have to write it down. It\\'s for her. You listen carefully You\\'re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out. Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby. - We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I\\'m working. This takes precedence. I\\'m in the middle of an interrogation. This moron is giving me everything. I don\\'t give everything. Look, you can\\'t pull me out of this right now. Natasha... Barton\\'s been compromised. Let me put you on hold. Where is Barton now? - We don\\'t know. - But he\\'s alive? We think so. I\\'ll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. I\\'ve got Stark. You get the big guy. Who are you? Get out! There is sickness here! You\\'re a doctor. My father\\'s not waking up! He has a fever and he\\'s moaning but his eyes won\\'t open. Slow down. My father... Like them? Please. You should\\'ve got paid up front, Banner. You know, for a man who\\'s supposed to be avoiding stress you picked a hell of a place to settle. Avoiding stress isn\\'t the secret. Then what is it? Yoga? You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart. I assume the whole place is surrounded. Just you and me. And your actress buddy? Is she a spy, too? They start that young? I did. Who are you? Natasha Romanoff. Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? Because that\\'s not going to work out for everyone. No, of course not. I\\'m here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D. S.H.I.E.L.D. How did they find me? We never lost you, Doctor. We\\'ve kept our distance. Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. Why? Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in. What if I say no? I\\'ll persuade you. And what if the other guy says no? You\\'ve been more than a year without an incident. I don\\'t think you want to break that streak. Well, I don\\'t every time get what I want. Doctor, we\\'re facing a potential global catastrophe. Well, those I actively try to avoid. This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. What does Fury want me to do, swallow it? He wants you to find it. It\\'s been taken. It emits a gamma signature that\\'s too weak for us to trace. There\\'s no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that\\'s where I\\'d be. So, Fury isn\\'t after the monster? Not that he\\'s told me. And he tells you everything? Talk to Fury. He needs you on this. He needs me in a cage? No one\\'s going to put you in a... Stop lying to me! I\\'m sorry. That was mean. I just wanted to see what you\\'d do. Why don\\'t we do this the easy way where you don\\'t use that and the other guy doesn\\'t make a mess. Okay? Natasha? Stand down. We\\'re good here. \"Just you and me.\" This is out of line, Director. You\\'re dealing with forces you can\\'t control. You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control? You\\'re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet? Not Asgard. Loki. He can\\'t be working alone. What about the other one? His brother. Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile but he\\'s worlds away. We can\\'t depend on him to help, either. It\\'s up to us. Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2. It was designed for exactly this... Phase 2 isn\\'t ready. Our enemy is. We need a response team. The Avengers Initiative was shut down. This isn\\'t about the Avengers. We\\'ve seen the list. You\\'re running the world\\'s greatest covert security network and you\\'re going to leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks. I\\'m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. You believe? War isn\\'t won by sentiment, Director. No, it\\'s won by soldiers. There\\'s not enough time. I got to put her in the water! You won\\'t be alone. Oh, my God. This guy is still alive! Trouble sleeping? I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I\\'ve had my fill. Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up, they say we won. They didn\\'t say what we lost. We\\'ve made some mistakes along the way. Some, very recently. Are you here with a mission, sir? I am. Trying to get me back in the world? Trying to save it. HYDRA\\'s secret weapon. Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That\\'s something the world sorely needs. Who took it from you? He\\'s called Loki. He\\'s not from around here. There\\'s a lot we\\'ll have to bring you up to speed on if you\\'re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me. Ten bucks says you\\'re wrong. There\\'s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? You should have left it in the ocean. Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you. You disconnected the transmission lines? Are we off the grid? Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works. I assume. Light her up. How does it look? Like Christmas, but with more me. We\\'ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I\\'m in DC tomorrow, I\\'m working on the zoning for the next three buildings. Pepper, you\\'re killing me. The moment, remember? Enjoy the moment. Get in here and I will. Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line. I\\'m not in. I\\'m actually out. Sir, I\\'m afraid he\\'s insisting. Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date. Levels are holding steady, I think. Of course they are. I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius? Well, I really wouldn\\'t know, now would I? What do you mean? All this came from you. No, all this came from that. Give yourself some credit. Please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself 12% of the credit. 12%? An argument can be made for 15. 12%? My baby? Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And, sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you. - My private elevator... - You mean our elevator? ...it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I\\'m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren\\'t I? It\\'s not going to be that subtle. I\\'ll tell you what. The next building is gonna say \"Potts\" on the tower. On the lease. Call your mom. Can you bunk over? Sir, the telephone. I\\'m afraid my protocols are being overridden. Mr Stark, we need to talk. You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark. - Please leave a message. - This is urgent. Then leave it urgently. Security breach. It\\'s on you. - Mr Stark. - Phil! Come in. \"Phil\"? I can\\'t stay. His first name is \"Agent.\" Come on in. We\\'re celebrating. Which is why he can\\'t stay. We need you to look this over as soon as possible. I don\\'t like being handed things. That\\'s fine, because I love to be handed things. So, let\\'s trade. Thank you. Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday. This isn\\'t a consultation. Is this about the Avengers? Which I know nothing about. The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn\\'t even qualify. I didn\\'t know that either. Apparently I\\'m volatile, self-obsessed, don\\'t play well with others. That I did know. This isn\\'t about personality profiles any more. Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second? Half a mo. You know, I thought we were having a moment. I was having 12% of a moment. This seems serious. Phil\\'s pretty shaken. How would you know if it\\'s... Why is he \"Phil\"? What is all this? This is this. I\\'m going to take the jet to DC tonight. Tomorrow. You have homework. You have a lot of homework. Well, what if I didn\\'t? - Lf you didn\\'t? - Yeah. You mean when you\\'ve finished? Well, then... Square deal. Fly safe. Work hard. So, any chance you\\'re driving by LaGuardia? - I can drop you. - Fantastic. I want to hear about the cellist. Is that still a thing? She moved back to Portland. What? Boo! We\\'re about 40 minutes out from home base, sir. So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me? A lot of people were. You were the world\\'s first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine\\'s original formula. Didn\\'t really go his way, did it? Not so much. When he\\'s not that thing, though, the guy\\'s like a Stephen Hawking. He\\'s like a smart person. I gotta say, it\\'s an honour to meet you officially. I\\'ve sort of met you. I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it\\'s really just a huge honour to have you on board this... I hope I\\'m the man for the job. Oh, you are. Absolutely. We made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. The uniform? Aren\\'t the stars and stripes a little old-fashioned? With everything that\\'s happening and the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned. The Chitauri grow restless. Let them gird themselves. I will lead them in the glorious battle. Battle? Against the meagre might of Earth? Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. You question us? You question him, he who put the sceptre in your hand? Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated? I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed. Your ambition is little and born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. You don\\'t have the Tesseract yet. I don\\'t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something sweet as pain. Stow the captain\\'s gear. Yes, sir. Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers. - Ma\\'am. - Hi. They need you on the bridge. They\\'re starting the face-trace. See you there. It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? Trading cards? They\\'re vintage. He\\'s very proud. Dr Banner. Yeah, hi. They told me you would be coming. Word is, you can find the Cube. Is that the only word on me? Only word I care about. It must be strange for you, all of this. Well, this is actually kind of familiar. Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It\\'s going to get a little hard to breathe. Flight crew, secure the deck. Is this a submarine? Really? They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container? No, no, this is much worse. Hover power check complete. Position cyclic. Increase collective to 8.0%. Preparing for maximum performance takeoff. Increase output to capacity. Power plant performing at capacity. We are clear. All engines operating. S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect. - We are at level, sir. - Good. Let\\'s vanish. Engage retro-reflection panels. Reflection panels engaged. Gentlemen. Doctor, thank you for coming. Thanks for asking nicely. So, how long am I staying? Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you\\'re in the wind. Where are you with that? We\\'re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones, laptops... If it\\'s connected to a satellite, it\\'s eyes and ears for us. That\\'s still not gonna find them in time. You have to narrow your field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? - How many are there? - Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I\\'ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? Agent Romanoff, could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please? You\\'re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. Put it over there. Where did you find all these people? S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. Is this the stuff you need? Yeah, iridium. It\\'s found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons. It\\'s very hard to get hold of. Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. Knows you need it. Well, I didn\\'t know. Hey! The Tesseract has shown me so much. It\\'s more than knowledge. It\\'s truth. I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? My next target. Tell me what you need. I need a distraction. And an eyeball. I mean, if it\\'s not too much trouble. No, no. It\\'s fine. It\\'s a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint. Slight foxing around the edges, but... We got a hit. A 67% match. Wait. Cross match, 79%. Location? Stuttgart, Germany. 28 K�nigstrasse. He\\'s not exactly hiding. Captain, you\\'re up. Kneel before me. I said kneel! Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It\\'s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life\\'s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. Not to men like you. There are no men like me. There are always men like you. Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. You know, the last time I was in Germany, and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. The soldier. The man out of time. I\\'m not the one who\\'s out of time. Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Kneel. Not today! The guy\\'s all over the place. Agent Romanoff. You miss me? Make your move, Reindeer Games. Good move. Mr Stark. Captain. Is he saying anything? Not a word. Just get him here. We\\'re low on time. I don\\'t like it. What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily? I don\\'t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop. Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow. What\\'s your thing, Pilates? What? It\\'s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things doing time as a Capsicle. Fury didn\\'t tell me he was calling you in. Yeah, there\\'s a lot of things Fury doesn\\'t tell you. Where\\'s this coming from? What\\'s the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning? I\\'m not overly fond of what follows. What are you doing? And now there\\'s that guy. Another Asgardian? - That guy\\'s a friendly? - Doesn\\'t matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract\\'s lost. Stark, we need a plan of attack! I have a plan. Attack. I\\'d sit this one out, Cap. I don\\'t see how I can. These guys come from legend. They\\'re basically gods. There\\'s only one God, ma\\'am. And I\\'m pretty sure he doesn\\'t dress like that. Where is the Tesseract? I missed you, too. Do I look to be in a gaming mood? You should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here to your precious Earth? I thought you dead. Did you mourn? We all did. Our father... Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? We were raised together. We played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I, who was, and should be, king! So you take the world I love as a recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. And you\\'re doing a marvellous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret. I mean to rule them, as why should I not? You think yourself above them? Well, yes. Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. A throne would suit you ill. I\\'ve seen worlds you\\'ve never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it... Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be king? - I am a king! - Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. I don\\'t have it. You need the Cube to bring me home. But I\\'ve sent it off, I know not where. You listen well, brother. I\\'m listening. Do not touch me again. Then don\\'t take my stuff. You have no idea what you\\'re dealing with. Shakespeare in the Park? Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes? This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. He gives up the Cube, he\\'s all yours. Until then, stay out of the way. Tourist. Okay. Power at 400% capacity. How about that? Hey! That\\'s enough. Now, I don\\'t know what you plan on doing here. I\\'ve come here to put an end to Loki\\'s schemes. Then prove it. Put that hammer down. Yeah... No. Bad call. He loves his hammer. You want me to put the hammer down? Are we done, here? In case it\\'s unclear, if you try to escape, if you so much as scratch that glass, it\\'s 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? Ant, boot. It\\'s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. Built for something a lot stronger than you. Oh, I\\'ve heard. A mindless beast. Makes play he\\'s still a man. How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can\\'t hope to control. You talk about peace, and you kill because it\\'s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. It burns you to have come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share. And then to be reminded what real power is. Well, let me know if \"real power\" wants a magazine or something. He really grows on you, doesn\\'t he? Loki\\'s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what\\'s his play? He has an army called the Chitauri. They\\'re not of Asgard, nor any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. An army from outer space. So, he\\'s building another portal. That\\'s what he needs Erik Selvig for. Selvig? - He\\'s an astrophysicist. - He\\'s a friend. Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours. I want to know why Loki let us take him. He\\'s not leading an army from here. I don\\'t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy\\'s brain is a bag full of cats. You could smell crazy on him. Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard. And he is my brother. He killed 80 people in two days. He\\'s adopted. I think it\\'s about the mechanics. Iridium... What do they need the iridium for? It\\'s a stabilising agent. I\\'m just saying, pick a weekend. I\\'ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. It means the portal won\\'t collapse on itself like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D. No hard feelings, Point Break. You\\'ve got a mean swing. Also, it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long, as Loki wants. Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails. That man is playing Galaga. He thought we wouldn\\'t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? He turns. Sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density. Something to kick-start the Cube. When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics? Last night. The packet, Selvig\\'s notes, the extraction theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect. Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. Finally, someone who speaks English. Is that what just happened? It\\'s good to meet you, Dr Banner. Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled. And I\\'m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage-monster. Thanks. Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him. I would start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. I don\\'t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I would like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. Monkeys? I do not understand. I do. I understood that reference. Shall we play, Doctor? This way, sir. The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig\\'s reports of the Tesseract. But it\\'s going to take weeks to process. If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster, we can clock this at around 600 teraflops. All I packed was a toothbrush. You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You\\'d love it. It\\'s Candy Land. Thanks, but the last time I was in New York, I kind of broke Harlem. Well, I promise a stress-free environment. No tension, no surprises. - Hey! - Nothing? Are you nuts? Jury\\'s out. You really have got a lid on it, haven\\'t you? What\\'s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? Is everything a joke to you? Funny things are. Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn\\'t funny. No offence, Doc. It\\'s all right, I wouldn\\'t have come aboard if I couldn\\'t handle pointy things. You\\'re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark. Do you think I\\'m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before? What isn\\'t he telling us? I can\\'t do the equation unless I have all the variables. You think Fury\\'s hiding something? He\\'s a spy. Captain, he\\'s \"the\" spy. His secrets have secrets. It\\'s bugging him, too. Isn\\'t it? I just want to finish my work here, and... Doctor? \"A warm light for all mankind.\" Loki\\'s jab at Fury about the Cube. I heard it. I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn\\'t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. The Stark Tower? That big, ugly building in New York? It\\'s powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? It\\'s just the prototype. I\\'m kind of the only name in clean energy right now. That\\'s what he\\'s getting at. So, why didn\\'t S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they doing in the energy business in the first place? I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s secure files. I\\'m sorry. Did you say... Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours, I\\'ll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide. Blueberry? Yet you\\'re confused about why they didn\\'t want you around. An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. I think Loki\\'s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don\\'t stay focused, he\\'ll succeed. We have orders. We should follow them. Following\\'s not really my style. And you\\'re all about style, aren\\'t you? Of the people in this room, which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit, and, B, not of use? Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you. Just find the Cube. That\\'s the guy my dad never shut up about? I\\'m wondering if they shouldn\\'t have kept him on ice. The guy\\'s not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us. What he\\'s got is an Acme dynamite kit. It\\'s going to blow up in his face. And I\\'m going to be there when it does. Yeah. I\\'ll read all about it. Or you\\'ll be suiting up with the rest of us. You see, I don\\'t get a suit of armour. I\\'m exposed. Like a nerve. It\\'s a nightmare. I\\'ve got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light, it\\'s part of me now, not just armour. It\\'s a terrible privilege. - But you can control it. - Because I learned how. It\\'s different. Hey, I read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you. So you\\'re saying that the Hulk... The other guy saved my life? That\\'s nice. It\\'s a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? I guess we\\'ll find out. You may not enjoy that. And you just might. As soon as Loki took the doctor, we moved Jane Foster. They\\'ve got an excellent observatory in Troms�. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She\\'ll be safe. Thank you. It\\'s no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he\\'s done. Erik is a good man. He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we\\'re more advanced but we come here, battling like bilge snipe. - Like what? - Bilge snipe. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. - You don\\'t have those? - I don\\'t think so. Well, they are repulsive. And they trample everything in their path. When I first came to Earth, Loki\\'s rage followed me here, and your people paid the price. And now, again. In my youth, I courted war. War hasn\\'t started yet. You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? I do not know. Loki\\'s mind is far afield. It\\'s not just power he craves, it\\'s vengeance, upon me. There\\'s no pain would prise his need from him. A lot of guys think that until the pain starts. What are you asking me to do? I\\'m asking, what are you prepared to do? Loki is a prisoner. Then why do I feel like he\\'s the only person on this boat that wants to be here? There\\'s not many people who can sneak up on me. But you figured I\\'d come. After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. I want to know what you\\'ve done to Agent Barton. I would say I\\'ve expanded his mind. And once you\\'ve won, once you\\'re king of the mountain, what happens to his mind? Is this love, Agent Romanoff? Love is for children. I owe him a debt. Tell me. Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I... Well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn\\'t care who I used it for, or on. I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me. He made a different call. And what will you do if I vow to spare him? Not let you out. No, but I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man. Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that. I\\'m Russian. Or I was. And what are you now? It\\'s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger, I\\'d like to wipe it out. Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Dreykov\\'s daughter, S�o Paulo, the hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping. It\\'s gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer. Pathetic! You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are part of you. And they will never go away. I won\\'t touch Barton, not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear. And then he\\'ll wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams, I\\'ll split his skull. This is my bargain, you mewling quim. You\\'re a monster. Oh, no. You brought the monster. So, Banner. That\\'s your play. What? Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab. I\\'m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you for your cooperation. What are you doing, Mr Stark? Kind of been wondering the same thing about you. You\\'re supposed to be locating the Tesseract. We are. The model\\'s locked and we\\'re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we\\'ll have the location within half a mile. Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss. What is \"Phase 2\"? Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses the Cube to make weapons. Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me. Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we\\'re making... I\\'m sorry, Nick. What were you lying? I was wrong, Director. The world hasn\\'t changed a bit. Did you know about this? You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor? I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed. Loki is manipulating you. And you\\'ve been doing what, exactly? You didn\\'t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. Yes, and I\\'m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I\\'d like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. Is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. Because of him. Me? Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. My people want nothing but peace with your planet. But you\\'re not the only people out there, are you? And you\\'re not the only threat. The world\\'s filling up with people who can\\'t be matched, that can\\'t be controlled. Like you controlled the Cube? Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war. A higher form? You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. A nuclear deterrent. Because that always calms everything right down. Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark. I\\'m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep... Hold on. How is this now about me? I\\'m sorry, isn\\'t everything? I thought humans were more evolved than this. Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up? You treat your champions with such mistrust. Are you boys really that na�ve? S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats. Captain America\\'s on threat watch? We all are. Wait, you\\'re on that list? Are you above or below angry bees? Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack... Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened. - Show some respect. - Respect what? Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes. I\\'ve got you on the computer, but not on the day log. What is your haul? Over. Arms and ammunition. Over. You speak of control, yet you court chaos. That\\'s his M.O., isn\\'t it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, we\\'re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We\\'re a time bomb. You need to step away. Why shouldn\\'t the guy let off a little steam? You know damn well why. Back off! I\\'m starting to want you to make me. Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour. Take that off, what are you? Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I\\'ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You\\'re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. I think I would just cut the wire. Always a way out. You may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero. A hero? Like you? You\\'re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle. Put on the suit. Let\\'s go a few rounds. You people are so petty and tiny. Yeah, this is a team. Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr Banner back to his... Where? You rented my room. The cell was just in case... In case you needed to kill me. But you can\\'t. I know, I tried. I got low. I didn\\'t see an end. So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good. Until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You want to know how I stay calm? Dr Banner, put down the sceptre. Got it. Sorry, kids, you don\\'t get to see my party trick after all. You located the Tesseract? I could get there fastest. The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it. - You\\'re not going alone. - You\\'re gonna stop me? Put on the suit, let\\'s find out. I\\'m not afraid to hit an old man. Put on the suit. Oh, my God. Put on the suit. Yeah. All hands to stations. - Hill! - External detonation. Number three engine is down. We\\'ve been hit. - Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three! Talk to me. Turbine looks mostly intact but it\\'s impossible to get out there to make repairs while we\\'re in the air. If we lose one more engine, we won\\'t be. Somebody\\'s got to get outside and patch that engine. - Stark, you copy that? - I\\'m on it. Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section then get to the armoury. Romanoff? We\\'re okay. We\\'re okay, right? - Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir. Detention, wait for cameras to go dark. - Got it. - Stay close. Let\\'s go, Level 4. Engine three. I\\'ll meet you there. Doctor? Bruce? You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We\\'re going to be okay. Listen to me. Are you hurt? We\\'re going to be okay. All right? I swear on my life, I will get you out of this. You will walk away and never ever... Your life? Bruce. Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south! - Take us to the water! - We\\'re flying blind. Navigation\\'s recalibrating after the engine failure. Is the sun coming up? - Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left. Get us over water. One more turbine goes down, and we drop. Thanks. Stark! Stark, I\\'m here! Good. Let\\'s see what we\\'ve got. I got to get this superconducting coolant system back online before I can access the rotors, work on dislodging the debris. I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position. What does it look like in there? It seems to run on some form of electricity. Well, you\\'re not wrong. We are not your enemies, Banner. Try to think! Okay, the relays are intact. What\\'s our next move? Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won\\'t re-engage without a jump. I\\'m going to have to get in there and push. If that thing gets up to speed, you\\'ll get shredded. That stator control unit can reverse the polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that could... Speak English! You see that red lever? It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it. Wait for my word. We need full evac on the lower hangar bay. Grenade! We\\'ve got a perimeter breach! Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear. Call-outs at every junction. We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4. Levels 2 and 3 are dark. Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart! Get his attention. Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile. Don\\'t get too close. Copy. Target acquired. Target engaged. Target angry, target angry! They\\'re not getting through here, so what the hell... Engine one is now in shut-down. We are in an uncontrolled descent. Sir, we\\'ve lost all power in engine one. It\\'s Barton. He took out our systems. He\\'s headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. Stark, we\\'re losing altitude. Yeah, I noticed. No! Are you ever not going to fall for that? The humans think us immortal. Should we test that? Move away, please. You like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don\\'t know what it does. Do you want to find out? No! Natasha? You\\'re going to lose. Am I? It\\'s in your nature. Your heroes are scattered. Your floating fortress falls from the sky. Where is my disadvantage? You lack conviction. I don\\'t think I\\'m... So, that\\'s what it does. All hands to crash stations immediately. Cap, hit the lever. I need a minute here! Lever now! Help! Sorry, boss. The god rabbited. Just stay awake. Eyes on me. No, I\\'m clocking out here. Not an option. It\\'s okay, boss. This was never gonna work if they didn\\'t have something to... Agent Coulson is down. A medical team is on its way to your location. They\\'re here. They called it. These were in Phil Coulson\\'s jacket. I guess he never did get you to sign them. We\\'re dead in the air up here. Our communications, the location of the Cube, Banner, Thor... I got nothing for you. I lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea. In heroes. Well, it\\'s an old-fashioned notion. You fell out of the sky. Did I hurt anybody? There\\'s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though. Lucky. Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell. - You saw? - The whole thing. Right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck-ass nude. Here. Didn\\'t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller. Thank you. Are you an alien? What? From outer space, an alien. No. Well, then, son, you\\'ve got a condition. Clint. You\\'re going to be all right. You know that? Is that what you know? I\\'ve got no window. I have to flush him out. You got to level out. It\\'s going to take time. You don\\'t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? Do you know what it\\'s like to be unmade? You know that I do. Why am I back? How did you get him out? Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard on the head. Thanks. Natasha... How many agents did I... Don\\'t. Don\\'t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic, and nothing we were ever trained for. Loki, did he get away? Yeah. I don\\'t suppose you know where. I didn\\'t need to know. I didn\\'t ask. He\\'s going to make his play soon, though. Today. We got to stop him. Yeah? Who\\'s \"we\"? I don\\'t know. Whoever\\'s left. Well, if I put an arrow through Loki\\'s eye socket, I would sleep better, I suppose. Now you sound like you. But you don\\'t. You\\'re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? He didn\\'t. I just... Natasha. I\\'ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I would like to wipe it out. Was he married? No. There was a cellist, I think. I\\'m sorry. He seemed like a good man. He was an idiot. Why? For believing? For taking on Loki alone. He was doing his job. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have... Sometimes there isn\\'t a way out, Tony. Right, I\\'ve heard that before. Is this the first time you lost a soldier? We are not soldiers. I\\'m not marching to Fury\\'s fife. Neither am I. He\\'s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does. But right now, we got to put that behind us and get this done. Loki needs a power source. If we can put together a list... He made it personal. That\\'s not the point. That is the point. That\\'s Loki\\'s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? To tear us apart. Yeah, divide and conquer is great but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That\\'s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart. Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night. And Loki, he\\'s a full-tilt diva, right? He wants flowers, he wants parades. He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered... Son of a bitch. Time to go. - Go where? - I\\'ll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets? I can. You got a suit? Yeah. Then suit up. Hey, you guys aren\\'t authorised to be in here. Son, just don\\'t. Sir. Agent Hill. Those cards, they were in Coulson\\'s locker, not in his jacket. They needed the push. We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6. They found him. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. - I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir. Sir, I\\'ve turned off the arc reactor but the device is already self-sustaining. Shut it down, Dr Selvig. It\\'s too late! She can\\'t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe. Okay. The barrier is pure energy. It\\'s unbreachable. Yeah, I got that. Plan B. Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment. Then skip the spinning rims. We\\'re on the clock. Please tell me you\\'re going to appeal to my humanity. Actually, I\\'m planning to threaten you. You should have left your armour on for that. Yeah. It\\'s seen a bit of mileage, and you\\'ve got the glow stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? Stalling me won\\'t change anything. No, no. Threatening. No drink? Are you sure? I\\'m having one. The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that. What have I to fear? The Avengers. That\\'s what we call ourselves. We\\'re sort of like a team. \"Earth\\'s mightiest heroes\"-type thing. Yes, I\\'ve met them. Yeah. It takes us a while to get any traction, I\\'ll give you that one. But let\\'s do a head count, here. Your brother, the demigod, a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend. A man with breathtaking anger-management issues, a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you\\'ve managed to piss off every single one of them. That was the plan. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they\\'ll come for you. I have an army. We have a Hulk. I thought the beast had wandered off. You\\'re missing the point. There is no throne. There is no version of this where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it\\'s too much for us, but it\\'s all on you. Because if we can\\'t protect the Earth, you can be damn well sure we\\'ll avenge it. How will your friends have time for me when they are so busy fighting you? This usually works. Well, performance issues, it\\'s not uncommon. One out of five... Jarvis, anytime now. You will all fall before me. Deploy! Deploy! And there\\'s one other person you pissed off. His name was Phil. Right. Army. Loki! Turn off the Tesseract, or I\\'ll destroy it. You can\\'t. There is no stopping it. There is only the war. So be it. Stark, we\\'re on your three, headed northeast. What? Did you stop for drive-through? Swing up Park. I\\'m going to lay them out for you. Sir, we have more incoming. Fine. Let\\'s keep them occupied. - Nat? - I see him. We got to get back up there. Stark, are you seeing this? Seeing. Still working on believing. Where\\'s Banner? Has he shown up yet? Banner? Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule? It\\'s too late. It\\'s too late to stop it. No. We can, together. Sentiment. We\\'ve got civilians still trapped up here. Loki. They\\'re fish in a barrel down there. We got this. It\\'s good. Go. Do you think you can hold them off? Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure. Just like Budapest all over again. You and I remember Budapest very differently. It\\'s going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard. National Guard? Does the army know what\\'s happening here? Do we? You need men in these buildings. There are people inside and they\\'re going to be running right into the line of fire. You take them to the basements or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. Why the hell should I take orders from you? I need men in those buildings. Lead the people down and away from the streets. We\\'re going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street. Well, we got its attention. What the hell was step two? What\\'s the story upstairs? The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable. Thor\\'s right. We got to deal with these guys. - How do we do this? - As a team. I have unfinished business with Loki. Yeah? Well, get in line. Save it. Loki\\'s going to keep this fight focused on us, and that\\'s what we need. Without him, these things could run wild. We got Stark up top. He\\'s going to need us to... So, this all seems horrible. I\\'ve seen worse. Sorry. No, we could use a little worse. - Stark, we got him. - Banner? Just like you said. Then tell him to suit up. I\\'m bringing the party to you. I don\\'t see how that\\'s a party. Dr Banner. Now might be a really good time for you to get angry. That\\'s my secret, Captain. I\\'m always angry. Hold on! Send the rest. Guys. Call it, Captain. All right, listen up. Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment. Barton, I want you on that roof. Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash. - Can you give me a lift? - Right. Better clench up, Legolas. Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You got the lightning. Light the bastards up. You and me, we stay here on the ground. We keep the fighting here. And Hulk... Smash. Sir. The Council is on. Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail. I\\'m just trying to keep them off the streets. Well, they can\\'t bank worth a damn. So find a tight corner. I will roger that. Oh, boy. Nice call. What else you got? Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth. And he didn\\'t invite me. Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing if we don\\'t close that portal. Our biggest guns couldn\\'t touch it. Well, maybe it\\'s not about guns. If you want to get up there, you\\'re going to need a ride. I got a ride. I could use a boost, though. Are you sure about this? Yeah. It\\'s gonna be fun. Okay, turn, turn. Less! Less! Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison. They\\'ve cornered a lot of civilians in there. I\\'m on it. Everyone! Clear out! Director Fury, the Council has made a decision. I recognise the Council has made a decision. But given that it\\'s a stupid-ass decision, I have elected to ignore it. Director, you\\'re closer than any of our subs. You scramble that jet... That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I\\'m certain my team can\\'t hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. If we don\\'t hold them here, we lose everything. If I send that bird out, we already have. You. Hawkeye! Nat, what are you doing? A little help? I got him. Enough! You are, all of you, beneath me! I am a god, you dull creature. And I will not be bullied by... Puny god. The sceptre... Doctor. Loki\\'s sceptre. The energy. The Tesseract can\\'t fight, but you can\\'t protect against yourself. It\\'s not your fault. You didn\\'t know what you were doing. Actually, I think I did. I built in a safety to cut their power source. Loki\\'s sceptre. It may be able to close the portal. And I\\'m looking right at it. Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell. Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah? I wouldn\\'t consider him a role model. Director Fury is no longer in command. Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1. 7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed. We\\'re go for takeoff. Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird. We need to shut it down! Repeat, takeoff is not authorised. Stark, do you hear me? You have a missile headed straight for the city. How long? Three minutes, max. The payload will wipe out Midtown. Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters. I just did. Package is sent. Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark. Are you ready for another bout? What, are you getting sleepy? Right at the crown! I can close it. Can anybody copy? I can shut the portal down. - Do it! - No, wait. Stark, these things are still coming. I got a nuke coming in. It\\'s gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it. Stark, you know that\\'s a one-way trip. Save the rest for the turn, J. Sir, shall I try Miss Potts? Might as well. The streets of New York City have become a battleground. The Army is here trying to contain the violence but clearly, it is outmatched. And I have to say, in all my years of reporting, I have never seen anything like this. We have limited information on the team but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark\\'s Iron Man... Come on, Stark. Close it. Son of a gun. He\\'s not slowing down. Is he breathing? What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me. We won. All right, yay! Hurray. Good job, guys. Let\\'s just not come in tomorrow. Let\\'s just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There\\'s a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don\\'t know what it is, but I want to try it. We\\'re not finished yet. And then shawarma after. If it\\'s all the same to you, I\\'ll have that drink now. Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack, the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers has been to many a cause not only for comfort, but for celebration. It\\'s just really great knowing they\\'re out there. That someone is watching over us. I love you, Thor! And then these guys were like... And then the air goes... And this green guy walks up and he goes... I don\\'t know. I don\\'t exactly feel safer with those things out there. It just seems that there\\'s a lot they\\'re not telling us. Superheroes in New York? Give me a break. These so-called \"heroes\" have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city. This was their fight. Where are they now? Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves. Their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance... What, this is all somehow their fault? Captain America saved my life. Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are, I would just... I would want to say thank you. Where are the Avengers? I\\'m not currently tracking their whereabouts. I\\'d say they\\'ve earned a leave of absence. And the Tesseract? The Tesseract is where it belongs. Out of our reach. That\\'s not your call. I didn\\'t make it. I just didn\\'t argue with the god that did. So, you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki, who should be answering for his crime. I think he will be. I don\\'t think you understand what you\\'ve started, letting the Avengers loose on this world. They\\'re dangerous. They surely are, and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. Was that the point of all this? A statement? A promise. Sir, how does it work now? They\\'ve gone their separate ways. Some, pretty extremely far. If we get into a situation like this again, what happens then? They\\'ll come back. Are you really sure about that? I am. Why? Because we\\'ll need them to. Humans. They are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled. To challenge them 1754is to court death. I still think about the night your mother and I had to leave you. Hopefully, it\\'s not for long, but I\\'ll call you when we get settled. When I have a better indication of what\\'s going on. Mommy? Jellybean. Daddy and I have a last-minute business trip... so Rose is gonna stay with you for a few days. No. I don\\'t want you to go. Ugh. It\\'s gonna be so boring. I won\\'t be able to keep my... eyes... Goodbye, sweetheart. All right, we\\'ll see you soon. Okay. Janet, we gotta go. I wish we could have put down our bags... tucked you back into your bed... but too many lives were at stake. Oh, my God. They\\'ve already launched. We have to stop it. Come on. To disarm the missile, we had to get inside it... but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules. I can\\'t get through. Hank. We both knew that if you go that small... there is no coming back. It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mother\\'s wasn\\'t. Tell Hope I love her. She turned it off. Janet. No! She went subatomic to deactivate the bomb. Your mother saved thousands of lives that day knowing she\\'d be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid. Gone forever. Telling you that she wasn\\'t coming home... was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. But then Scott showed up. Or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the quantum realm... and came back. Everything changed. I started to wonder... could your mother still be alive? So, I dusted off some old plans. Dad, what are you saying? I think it\\'s possible to bring her back. Okay. We\\'re in. Oh, this place is a maze. Where\\'s that map? We\\'re definitely close. - You ready? - I\\'m ready, Daddy. Are you sure? \\'Cause once we\\'re inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we\\'re done. I eat fear for breakfast. Wow. That is super cool. Come on. Look! It\\'s Anton. He\\'ll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? Anton, which way do we go? Thanks, Anton! Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility. Oh no, lasers! Oh! I think I got lased! The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens. Yup. Perfect! Right there. There! It\\'s the micro-treasure! My trophy? It looks like treasure. Oh, it is to me. I want to take it to show-and-tell. Oh, no, you can\\'t do that. You can\\'t. It never leaves the house. It\\'s too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I\\'m so touched you think I\\'m the world\\'s greatest grandma. It was the only one they had. It makes me want to knit you a sweater. Oh, no, the fuzz! Hey, Scotty... I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings... and I think we have way too many security cameras, don\\'t we? No, no, not at all. I mean, \\'cause it\\'s a lot of security cameras. I know what he needs. Who\\'s the security expert in our business? You are, but I\\'m running the company, right? And if we overquote him... he\\'s gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird. He ain\\'t goin\\' anywhere. And the expression is \"land this fish.\" No, it\\'s \"land the bird.\" Just like you land the plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. I know it\\'s silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do. How am I gonna land a fish? It can\\'t walk. And if it swam up on shore... and it battled a hawk, who\\'s gonna win? You\\'ve really turned me around on this thing. It\\'s okay. We\\'re gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me... I\\'m in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. I\\'m gonna go recheck it. To the escape ant! Let\\'s bounce before the po-po come back! The po-po? How do you even know that? Let\\'s fly, Antoinette! Let\\'s fly! Crash landing! Whoo! I wish we could shrink for real. Oh. That is pretty cool. Hey, I\\'m headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I\\'m way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff. And my hands are shaking. But I think it\\'s unrelated, you know? It\\'s gonna be great, Luis! You got nothing to worry about! Yeah, yeah. I\\'m the boss. I\\'m the boss. I\\'m the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Daddy! Come on, Woo! I\\'ve got three days left. Why would I try to escape? Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern, soup to nuts. Thank you. It was an accident. My foot went through the fence. Our flying ant crashed. Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old when you can\\'t leave the house. You know the lengths that I\\'ve gone to? Close-up magic. I learned that. Why can\\'t you just leave my daddy alone? Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way. Your school has rules, right? Like, you can\\'t draw on the walls. Well, your daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords. Now, as a part of his joint plea deal... with Homeland Security and the German government... he was allowed to return to the U.S... provided he serve two years under house arrest... followed by three years of probation. And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology... or contact with any former associates who were... or currently are in violation of said Accords. Or any related statutes. Okay, sweetie? Wow. You\\'re really great with kids. Thanks. I\\'m also a youth pastor. Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot... but you haven\\'t had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you? - No. - You sure? Because it\\'s only a matter of time before we get \\'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And, uh, I don\\'t need to remind you... that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum. I haven\\'t talked to Hank or Hope in forever. They hate his guts. Thanks, peanut. How\\'d you do it, Scott? Do what? The card trick. Seriously? Oh, my God! You people can\\'t just show up here whenever you want and search the place. Actually, they can. You need a warrant. Actually, they don\\'t. Really? Wow. Did you pack your soccer shoes? - Yeah. - All right. Next time I see you will be on the outside. All right. Oh, get on the inside of this. Hey, three days. Seriously... - I\\'m proud of you, bud. - Thank you. You know what? Give me another one. Me too! Gosh! Freedom! New business! I am sensing greatness. I had a fun weekend, Daddy. Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend. Once I\\'m outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red. We\\'ll have so much ice cream, we\\'ll never stop puking. You\\'re gettin\\' good at that. How\\'d you do that? - Bye, Daddy. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Three days. Easy-peasy. Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there. And that is misdirection. � We had a dream � We\\'d go travelin\\' together � We\\'d spread a little lovin\\' then we\\'d keep movin\\' on � Easy-peasy. Where are you? Everything that you know... Lost... in the quantum realm. What? I\\'m gonna find you, Jellybean. I found you! You always find me, Mommy. What the hell? Hey, Hank! It\\'s been a while. Um, I don\\'t even know if this is your number anymore. And I\\'m probably the last person you wanna hear from. But I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn\\'t sound like an emergency or anything... but it just felt very real. I was back in the quantum realm... and I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way or anything. You know, hearing this out loud, I\\'m thinking, uh, it\\'s not an emergency. I\\'m sorry to bother you. I\\'m sorry for a lot of things. That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be... Could be one, little, tiny universe. Hope? Is this another dream? Do you think it was a dream... or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there? I\\'m not sure. I can\\'t be here! I can\\'t be here! I\\'m under house arrest! They won\\'t open while the system\\'s engaged, Scott. You have to take me home. They could show up any second! Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you\\'re still at home. Whoa! Scotty? He\\'s programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed. Five hours in front of the TV. Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that\\'s about. That\\'s totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me? We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far the biggest one we\\'ve had is you. I\\'m sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security. That Cap needed help, so... Cap? Tain America. Captain. Cap. It\\'s what we call him. If you\\'re a friend. I\\'m not saying I\\'m a friend of... A little, I know him. He\\'s nice. Whatever. I\\'m sorry! All right? I didn\\'t think I\\'d get caught. You didn\\'t think about a lot of things. How\\'s Hank? We\\'re still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom. How do you think he is? I\\'m sorry. I know you\\'re mad. I\\'m not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we\\'re even talking is... because we need what\\'s in your head. Is this where you\\'re living? If you need help or money or something, maybe I can... We\\'re fine. Hey, Hank. Look, I just wanna... Save it! - Can we start? - Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home... we were building this. It\\'s a tunnel. To the quantum realm. To my mom. We think she might still be down there. We just don\\'t know where. What? If we can pinpoint my mom\\'s location... then the pod can take me down to get her. You built all this and you don\\'t even know if she\\'s alive? It\\'s called a hypothesis. Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It was overloaded and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the quantum realm was opened. And? And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom. We think when you were down there, you may have entangled with her. Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much. Quantum entanglement, Scott. We think she might have put some kind of a message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it. Your mom put a message in my head? Come on. That\\'s insane. No, Scott. Insane is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren\\'t lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it. I did, I destroyed it, I swear. I can\\'t believe you destroyed my suit! That was my life\\'s work! What was I supposed to do? You were supposed to not take my suit! I\\'m sorry, Hank! I\\'m sorry I took the suit. I\\'m sorry that I called last night. I don\\'t remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide-and-seek with a little girl. What? I had a dream. She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. Doesn\\'t mean anything. But was it Cassie in the dream? No. Where was she hiding? - What? - The little girl. Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe? No, it was in a tall dresser. You mean a wardrobe. Is that what that\\'s called? What color was it? Red. Were there horses on it? Oh, boy. It\\'s where I hid every time that we played. It doesn\\'t sound like you really got the gist of the game. She\\'s alive. I knew it. I knew it! We need to get that part. Okay. The sooner we get the tunnel working... the sooner we can get this message out of his head. Does Burch have it? - Yeah. Let\\'s go. - What part? Who\\'s Burch? Wait. What\\'s happening? We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change. Look, I\\'d really like to help you... but if I\\'m not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor... then I\\'m going away forever. Once we get the component and power up the tunnel... we\\'ll get the message, and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement won\\'t last. You owe us. All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I\\'m not supposed to be out here. Let\\'s go. - We good? - Yeah. I\\'ll be right back. - Can I have one of these? - No. Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui! Sonny! Oui is French for \"yes.\" As in \"yes\" to farm-to-table, \"yes\" to locally sourced... and \"yes\" to planet before profit. Well, let\\'s hope it also means \"yes\" to \"Do you have the component I ordered?\" You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan. Have a seat. No, I\\'m good. Thank you. Who is this guy? Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. He\\'s been getting us what we need to build the tunnel. Could I just have one... No. You know, I have a special friend at the FBI. And I say \"special\"... because, well, he tells me things that I didn\\'t previously know. For example... your name isn\\'t Susan. It\\'s Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, that\\'s your father, Hank Pym. - That\\'s not good, Hank. - No shit. What do you want? Relationships are built on trust, Hope. And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation. Our relationship? My business landscape has been shifting, Hope. Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don\\'t even exist anymore... but now, Hank Pym... Hank Pym is a real opportunity. Do you have a point? Oh, you think that I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been building with all this? Quantum technology. Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI, forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It\\'s the next gold rush. Is that so? I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty... of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid... one billion dollars. Thank you, Sonny, really. But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So I\\'ll just take the component as arranged. My buyers don\\'t take no for an answer. So, we are either in business together... or we aren\\'t in business together. Then I guess we aren\\'t. You can go. But I\\'m afraid your money\\'s gonna have to remain. Let\\'s call it compensation for my injured feelings. Listen, Sonny. This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component. Darlin\\', the only thing you\\'re takin\\' from here... is my heart, but it will mend in time. Okay. So, now what? You\\'ll see. She said her and her daddy had something pressing. - Mmm-hmm. - I want to know what it is because if they\\'re not working with us... they\\'re working with somebody. So find out. I want some names... Hold on, you gave her wings? Get her. Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier! Stop firing! Stop! All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go! Go! Wings and blasters. So I take it you didn\\'t have that tech available for me. No, I did. It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny. Oh, our business isn\\'t finished yet, Hope. I can assure you of that! What in the hell is that? Dad, are you seeing this? Hope, get out of there! - I gotta do something. - Wait! It is still a work in progress. You taught me that kick. Remember? Yeah, great form. Those were the days. Whatever happened to us? Not the time, Scott. Damn it, where\\'d it go? I\\'ve lost it. I\\'m not seeing anything on the ant cams. Try looking... Dad? Give me that. Now. - Are you okay? - No! He got the lab. No. Come on! What was that? I don\\'t know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is. So, where to now? How about my house? Hmm? I\\'m supposed to be there anyway, and Woo could walk in any second. Exactly why we\\'re not going to your house. What about your house? Sorry. Well, there is one place I can think of. No. No, no, no, no! No! Wow, Dr. Pym... who would\\'ve thought that, once again, in your hour of need... that you would turn to us, you know? Not me. Mmm. Help yourself. Hey, what\\'s up with the fancy pastry? We gotta keep the food budget down. Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast? The oatmeal packets. Oatmeal packets. - It\\'s insult. - Why is it an insult? Because it tastes like sand. You know why? \\'Cause it\\'s organic. It\\'s not organic, it\\'s sand. It\\'s the most important meal of the day. You know what, you can get creative with it. Break teeth. Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon. Put a little honey. Whatever you want... Guys, guys, guys. Come on, man. We got bigger fish to fry. Is that my desk? - Yeah. - What? Why do I have such a small desk? Because you weren\\'t there when we were choosing desks. You snooze, you lose. Well, I was under house arrest. Yeah. You know what, this isn\\'t even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage. I got it at a rummage sale. So, you save money on my desk? Guys. Hope, please, we need to focus, all right? We gotta find that lab already. Jeez. Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff. Like a ghost. Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga, the witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga? Whoever stole it... we need to find it. Oh, you don\\'t find someone like that. They find you. Like Baba Yaga. Dr. Pym, you\\'re the smartest genius I know. Didn\\'t you put some kind of LoJack on your lab? Because if you didn\\'t, we have a variety of affordable options. Of course I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing. They also looked like they were phasing. Phasing? Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter. Oh, yeah, that\\'s what I was thinking. The lab emits radiation. Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab. Where else can we find that equipment? Well, there is one person. Bill Foster. Great! Who\\'s Bill Foster? He\\'s an old colleague of my dad\\'s, from S.H.I.E.L.D. They had a falling out years ago. You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It\\'s probably just a waste of time. Hey, I\\'m risking everything by being here. Don\\'t you think we should check? We need to find out who took the lab. Guys, it\\'s not a good idea to be out in the open like this. Relax, no one\\'s gonna recognize us. What, because of hats and sunglasses? That\\'s not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves at a baseball game. In an isolated system... particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter... each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words, the object in question would be both in and out of phase... with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality. I am noticing an unusually high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why don\\'t we call it a few minutes early? That\\'ll be enough for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go. It\\'s incredible. You\\'re linked to Janet. It\\'s quantum entanglement between the quantum states of Posner molecules in your brains. Yeah, that\\'s what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word \"quantum\" in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I\\'d love to help you... but I don\\'t have anything like the equipment you\\'re describing. I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let\\'s go. Don\\'t condescend, Hank. You\\'re the one who\\'s on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego. That wasn\\'t me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really? Going that big, it must\\'ve been exhausting. I slept for three days straight. You have no idea. Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hank\\'s partner on a project called Goliath. Excuse me? You were my partner? The only thing more tiring than going that big is putting up with Hank\\'s bullshit. Right... I don\\'t know. How big did you get? My record? 21 feet. - Not bad. - You? I don\\'t... No, really, I\\'m curious. - 65 feet. Yeah. - Whoa! - Huge. - 65. If you two are finished comparing sizes... we need to figure out a way to track down the lab. And the great Hank Pym hasn\\'t figured that one out yet? Strange. You had all the answers back in the day. That\\'s why I left the project. Left? I fired you. Best decision I ever made. Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental... stubborn, impatient. Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away. Just the mediocrities. Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out. Watch it, Bill. She paid the price, though, didn\\'t she? You son of a bitch. I didn\\'t come here to listen to you two squabble. I\\'m trying to save my mother. Now, which office would you say? Oh, it\\'s Woo. Someone must have seen me. Relax. If this is about you, they\\'d be in your house by now. What are you, 15? Come on. We gotta go right now. Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker... if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators. - That could work. - I don\\'t know what that means. Thank you. Thank you. But, Doctor, campus police says they ID\\'d both Pym and Van Dyne. I don\\'t know what to tell you, Agent. I haven\\'t talked to Hank in 30 years. I can assure you I\\'m the last person he would want to visit. Oh, come on, you expect us to... Hey, hey. Why is that? Simple. We hate each other\\'s guts. So I\\'m a terrible partner? Foster, he hasn\\'t had one good idea in his unremarkable career. But his idea about the diffractors could work, right? Fine, one decent idea. Except, I eliminated the diffractors when I upgraded the suits. So, if we had an old suit, we might be able to track down the lab? Yes, but we don\\'t. - What if we did? - What do you mean? I mean... life\\'s funny. Oh, my God. You didn\\'t destroy the suit. What? Well, it was your life\\'s work, Hank. I couldn\\'t destroy that. Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis. You sent my suit through the mail? Hey, the postal service is very reliable. You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS. Where is it? It\\'s in a very safe place, all right? Don\\'t worry. What, the trophy? No, it\\'s not here. What do you mean it\\'s not there? Where could it be? I looked everywhere. It\\'s not here. Hey, get away from the plant. But I put it back after Cassie and I... Show-and-tell. Scotty? No, stop! Well, the good news is I know where it is. Whenever you go back to school... isn\\'t everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. What is it? It\\'s the new regulator. Hank, what\\'s going on with this suit? How much of a work in progress is this? Uh-oh. No, no, no. Oh. What are you, laughing? Please, could you just... Okay, okay. What do you see? The sizing coils are malfunctioning. Just let me... Ow! - Sorry. - It\\'s all right. Okay. All right. Try that. Sorry. What? Awesome. If only Cap could see you now. Hilarious. What are we gonna do? Hey! Where\\'s your hall pass? Hey, I\\'m talking to you. Hey! Hey. Eh... You can do it. You almost got it. Oh, peanut. Okay, let\\'s go. Hiya, champ, how was school today? All right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit? So cranky. You want a juice box and some string cheese? Do you really have that? Let\\'s see if Foster was right. This has gotta be the lab. Let\\'s go get it. Yeah. This seems right. Look at us, teaming up twice in one day. Makes you think, huh? About what? Germany. What do you mean? We were working together, training together... and other stuffing together. If I had asked you, would you have come? I guess we\\'ll never know. But I do know one thing. What? If I had, you\\'d have never been caught. Hey, Scott. You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Okay, you\\'re transmitting. What took you so long? Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant. I\\'m thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. You like it? Hilarious. I\\'m not getting anything on the monitors. There\\'s some kind of electronic disturbance. Be careful. You know me, Hank. I\\'m always careful... Whoa! It\\'s okay. It\\'s just the suit. - How do you know? - Look. That\\'s Ghost? What is she doing? Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff? Let\\'s just get outta here before she wakes up. Hope, look! There\\'s the lab. Now, we\\'re sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else\\'s, right? Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast. I\\'ll get it. Oh, shit... Hope. Hope! Hank. Guys. I don\\'t think they can hear you. Hi. I\\'m Ava. Scott. So, you don\\'t need the suit... to go through things. No. It just helps me control it. And the pain, supposedly. You\\'re not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart, are you? You\\'re funny. I\\'m not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to. I need... what\\'s in your head. Let\\'s wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on! Dad? Don\\'t ever touch him again. Now, now, Hope... I think I\\'m being rather gentle with your father, all things considered. What the hell are you talking about? Another casualty of Hank Pym\\'s ego. Bill. What have you done? It\\'s what you\\'ve done, Dr. Pym. You\\'re with her? Oh, man. I thought you were cool. What the hell is going on here? I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father. Why would he? Elihas Starr. They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D. Quantum research. Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym. You had him fired. Oh, and discredited for good measure. My father tried to continue his research on his own. Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks. No, no, no! Too many. Until something went wrong. He told us to run. Elihas, what\\'s happening? Just go. Go! Daddy! Daddy! I could tell he was scared. Daddy! Ava, no! I didn\\'t want him to be alone. No! No! When I woke up, my parents were dead. I wasn\\'t so lucky. They call it \"molecular disequilibrium.\" A rather dull name, I think. Doesn\\'t quite do justice to what it means. Every cell in my body is torn apart... and stitched back together. Over and over. Every day. I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a quantum anomaly in Argentina. Hello, Ava. My name\\'s Bill. I was a friend of your father\\'s. I brought you something. It\\'s all right. Try again. That\\'s it. Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe. But others at S.H.I.E.L.D. saw an opportunity in my affliction. They built me a containment suit, so I could control my phasing. And trained me to be a stealth operative. They weaponized me. I stole for them. Spied for them. Killed for them. And in exchange for my soul... they were going to cure me. They lied. When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in. I built the chamber to slow her decay, but her condition was progressive. I didn\\'t know how to cure it. She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no... and that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, she discovered that you were building the tunnel. Then, she told me about Lang. And the message from Janet inside his head, that\\'s when I... Christ\\'s sake! That\\'s me. I\\'m sorry. Look, can you tell me who\\'s texting me? \"Cassie, 911.\" That\\'s my daughter. I need to text her back. No, that\\'s not happening. What, it\\'s 911. That means it\\'s an emergency. You\\'re not making demands here, Lang. You\\'re not appreciating the gravity of the... Okay, look, she\\'s trying to video chat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please. Cassie, are you okay? What\\'s the emergency? I can\\'t find my soccer shoes. What? I have a game tomorrow. Hey, Scott, I know that they\\'re there. Can you just walk the phone around the house? No, I can\\'t do that right now. - Why not? - Because I\\'m sick. Hey, can you just maybe look around later then and call me back? Please? Thank you. Bye, Daddy! - Bye, peanut! - Feel better! Feel better, buddy! I\\'m sorry. It said emergency. Ava, I want to help you. She doesn\\'t need your help. I know how to save her. Oh, really? How? Janet. For the last 30 years, she\\'s been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Ava\\'s molecular structure... Extract it? - Yes. - Are you insane? That would rip Janet apart. You don\\'t know that. I\\'m gonna fire up your tunnel. When Janet\\'s location pops into Lang\\'s head, he\\'s gonna give it to me... or I\\'m gonna turn him over to the FBI. What? You are gonna stay here... just in case I need your help. Like hell I would help you! You\\'ll do whatever I say. You\\'re gonna kill Janet! I\\'d be more worried about yourself, Hank. Goddamn it, Bill! - Dad? - Calm down, Hank. So help me God... The pills. It\\'s his heart! He needs his pills. Please, Dr. Foster. They\\'re in the tin. Please. He could die! Come on! Help him! Dad, just hang on, all right? Just keep breathing. Stay calm. Help him, man! Come on! The Altoid tin! Wait! Thanks, guys. Hank! Bill is filling that girl\\'s head with lies. Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans. Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in. No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side. Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch. Good job. It\\'ll work. Foster, he could have fried the entire system. Look, we\\'ll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings, all right? It\\'s going to be fine. So, this is it. Yeah. You\\'d think with all this time to prepare I\\'d be more ready. Oh, going subatomic isn\\'t something you can prepare for. It kind of melts your mind. I mean seeing my mom again. Oh. What if she\\'s a completely different person? Yeah, like, uh, George Washington. I\\'m serious, Scott. Or George Jefferson. What if she\\'s forgotten about me? When I was in prison... the only thing that got me through was Cassie. I could have been locked up for 100 years... I never would have forgotten her. I know your mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again. Thank you. Hey. We got a big problem. You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. Oh, no. And they\\'re on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. Uh, yeah, look, it\\'s been a little crazy. Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it. No. No, no, no, no. The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. I can\\'t. I wish I could, but I can\\'t leave. You know what, I\\'m coming to you. I\\'ll just bring the plans. They\\'re on the laptop. And you can fix them there. Just tell me where you are, okay? It\\'s complicated. What do you mean it\\'s complicated? As you can see, sir, this system is state of the art. Security of tomorrow, today. Oh, that\\'s so good! And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin\\'. Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty\\'s, so we can fix the plans. But don\\'t worry, I\\'ll be back in plenty of time. - As you can see... - Oh, oh, oh! Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning. Down to the undercarriage, baby. You sprung for the undercarriage wash? Well, you said get the works. That\\'s a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota. He\\'s right. The undercarriage wash, that\\'s for cleaning off road salt... laid down in our more snow-laden sister states. Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol? Well, my name is Sonny Burch. And I do my research, Luis. To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine... at the FBI that you are a known associate of Scott Lang... a known associate of Hank Pym, who I\\'ve also learned... has a portable shrinking laboratory... filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you\\'re gonna tell me where it is. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis. And I have promised results to some dangerous people. So, I\\'m gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman. Now... Uzman is a master at extracting information from the unwilling... through psychoactive means. Oh, is that truth serum? There\\'s no such thing as truth serum. That\\'s just nonsense from TV. Well, what is it then? It\\'s a little concoction that he\\'s been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S. It makes you suggestible and highly responsive. Well, dude, that\\'s truth serum. No, it\\'s not. No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me. - Right? - It\\'s not a truth serum. Okay. Hey, I believe you. It\\'s not a truth serum. I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks... The truth serum. Well, I have a lot of allergies... so you might wanna think about that. We\\'ve got to get that lab back. What? The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore. How long have I got? A couple of weeks, maybe. Well, then we\\'ll make them bring the lab back. How? Lang. He has a daughter, right? You can\\'t mean that. Ava! I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there... but I won\\'t be a part of anything like that. You\\'re not the one who\\'s about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! You said you could fix me! You promised. I know. I will. But not like that. You lay one finger on that little girl... I won\\'t help you. And we\\'re done. Fine. There are other options. You know what? You\\'re right. This isn\\'t truth serum. Because I don\\'t feel anything. That was a lie. I do feel something. This is truth serum! There\\'s no such thing! Okay. Okay, okay. Now, I\\'m gonna make this real easy for you, Luis. Okay. Where is Scott Lang? Well, see, that\\'s complicated. Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I\\'m not talkin\\' about cell block D. His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like... \"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you\\'re on lockup?\" And he was, like, \"Yeah, I know. \"I thought I was gonna be with her forever... \"but now I\\'m all alone.\" And I was, like, \"Damn, homie. You know what? \"You gotta chin up, because you\\'ll find a new partner. \"But you know what? I\\'m Luis.\" And he says, \"You know what? I\\'m Scotty, \"and we\\'re gonna be best friends.\" Okay, hold on, hold on. I like a good story as much as the next person... but what in the hell does this have to do with where Scott Lang is? I\\'m getting there. I\\'m getting there. You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out. He like human jukebox. Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant! Yeah, only played Morrissey. And if anybody ever complained, she\\'d be like... You know, Chicanos, we call him \"Moz.\" Then, ¡adios! What can I say? We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know? - Lang! - Right, right, right. So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail, and he starts working for Hank. That\\'s when he met Hope. And Hope\\'s all, like... \"I want nothing to do with you. \"Look at my hairdo, I\\'m all business.\" And then Scotty\\'s, like, \"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken. \"And I\\'ll probably never find love again, \"but damn if I want to kiss you!\" But then you fast forward and they\\'re all into each other, right? And then Scotty\\'s, like, \"You know what? I can\\'t tell you this... \"but I\\'m gonna go trash an airport with Captain America.\" And then she said, \"I can\\'t believe you split like that! \"Smell you later, dummy.\" So, Scotty goes on house arrest. And he won\\'t admit it, but his heart is all, like... \"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been \"my new true partner, but I blew it!\" But fate brought \\'em back together. And then Hope\\'s heart is all... \"I\\'m worried that I can\\'t trust him... \"and he\\'s gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!\" And then my heart is all, like... \"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company\\'s red \"and we\\'re days away from going out of business. Oh!\" \"Out of business\"? \"Days away\"? Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss, but we\\'re broke! And the Karapetyan\\'s our last hope. And if we don\\'t show up, we\\'re done! That\\'s terrible bossing! Damn, bro! - That\\'s on me! That\\'s on me! - Hey! Enough. I\\'m gonna ask you one more time. Where is Scott Lang? I\\'ve been trying to tell you, he\\'s in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking. Emotionally speaking. Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking! Oh! The woods. The woods? Baba Yaga! What do you mean, \"the woods\"? The Muir Woods, the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway! For God\\'s sake! � Baba Yaga, come at night � Little children, sleepy tight � Damn it! If that freak gets Pym\\'s tech... I\\'m never gonna see it. So, what do we do now? It\\'s easier to steal it from the Feds than from the boogeyman. Hey, it\\'s me. How\\'d you like to get a promotion? I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang. But you gonna have to take \\'em down now, because they ain\\'t gonna be there for long. And when you do, you gonna get me that lab. Understood. Good news, gentlemen. Feds are gonna do the hard work for us. What are you lookin\\' at? Change my tires! Right. - Sir. - Can you knock? Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead. Ooh, I love leads. System\\'s in the green. Priming the coils. Full charge. As soon as the tunnel\\'s open... let us know if you get anything that could be a part of her message. Yeah, yeah. I will. Okay, then. Here it goes. We did it! You got anything? Nothin\\'. Well, just give it a minute, because it could... No. No, no, no, no! What\\'s happening? It\\'s shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off. We\\'ve gone over them a million times, I know they\\'re right! Then what else could it be? I don\\'t know! - Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that! Scott, you can\\'t... I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 years down here... I\\'ve thought about it a lot. Janet? Hi, honey. Jellybean. Mom? It\\'s not the reunion I\\'d imagined. It\\'s all so rushed. You two have done such great work. You just need a little... nudge. Janet, how is this possible? It wasn\\'t a message you put in Scott\\'s head. It was an antenna. Clever girl. I\\'m so proud of you. Honey, tell us where you are. Tell us how to find you. No, the probability fields are too complex. That\\'s why I needed to talk to you. You have to follow my voice. Of course! Like tracing a call back to its source! I\\'m tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies... between point two and point nine. I\\'d narrow it to four and six. That\\'s too tight. We could miss you. Look at us squabbling again. Fine. All right, between three and seven. Our first fight in decades, and it\\'s over just like that. Bullseye. Source lock. It\\'s you. We got it! You have to meet me at these exact coordinates. In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void. It\\'s very dangerous, especially on the human mind, so be careful. Time and space work very differently down here. You have two hours. After that, the probability fields will shift... and it\\'ll be another century before they align like this again. We\\'ll find you. I know you will, Jellybean. Nope. Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet. Perfect. How did we get up here? All right, first you\\'re gonna see all kinds of lights... and it\\'s gonna get really trippy... but then it\\'s gonna turn black and silent. Really silent. Scott, I\\'ll be fine. I\\'m just saying because I\\'ve been down there. Yeah, so you\\'ve mentioned. Um, sorry. I have to take this. Hey, man, you coming? No, I\\'m not, but you know what? Ghost is. And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are. - What? - I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. Uh, they gave me some truth serum. And then all of a sudden I started talkin\\' all honestly. Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher. I hate it, I hate it. - Uh... - But you need to go home... because the Feds are probably going there now! And by the way... who puts the plates on the top rack? They don\\'t go there! I feel like such a jerk. You\\'re gonna be really mad. We gotta go now. What? Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI. How? - I told Luis where we are. - You what? I told him to come here so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal. Oh, my God! Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we lose the business! Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days? Jesus, Scott! 90 seconds to close the aperture! You have to depolarize the coils first! I know! I\\'m really sorry... but the, um, FBI is coming to my place so... I have to go. Can I borrow the suit? Gyroscopic stabilizers. Powering on. I\\'m just gonna borrow the suit. I\\'ll come back. Just tell me where you\\'ll be. - Don\\'t bother. - What? We\\'ll come and get the suit from you, as soon as we\\'ve found my mom. - Hope... - Scott, just go! - Scott? - Daddy? It\\'s us, buddy! We\\'re here for Cassie\\'s shoes! He must be resting. Honey, why don\\'t you go upstairs and look under your bed? Daddy, you upstairs? Daddy? What the... He really lives like a pig these days. Daddy? Spread out! Again? You people have no shame! The monitor says that he\\'s in the bathroom. Yeah, I\\'m not buying it! Cassie, let the man get by! But Daddy\\'s super sick! I\\'ll see about that! He says he doesn\\'t want anyone else to get sick! I\\'ll take my chances, sweetie. He barfed. Like, a lot. Young lady, I\\'m a federal agent. I\\'ve seen worse things than vomit. Like, \"a lot\" a lot? - Yes! - Forget it, move aside! No! Woo! - What are you doing here? - Scott. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just really sick. I told you. Excuse me. Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know? Sorry. I\\'ll start the van. You get the lab. Freeze! You\\'re surrounded! Hank Pym... Hope Van Dyne... you\\'re under arrest. This is harassment! Actually, it\\'s not. What does the FBI even stand for... \"Forever Bothering Individuals\"? - His monitor check out? - Of course it does. Damn it! Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey. We got \\'em sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody. Seriously? Yes! Oh, I\\'m sorry, Scott. They\\'re your friends. That\\'s insensitive. I just really needed a win, you know? Anyway, I\\'ll be back later for the official end of your sentence! Sorry for misjudging you, pal! You should feel great about yourself! What is it? We have a man down. And Pym\\'s lab is gone. Hey. Thanks for covering for me. Sure. So... how long have you been Ant-Man again? Not long. It just sort of happened. I\\'m sorry for lying to you... and I\\'m sorry for risking everything. Daddy, it\\'s okay. It\\'s not. I do some dumb things... and the people that I love the most pay the price. Mainly you. Trying to help people isn\\'t dumb. I screw it up just about every time. So, maybe you just need someone watching your back... like a partner. Well, she\\'s made it clear that\\'s about the last thing she wants. Who? Hope. Wait, who did you think? Me. You? Don\\'t laugh. I\\'d be a great partner. Aw, peanut. Aw. You would be awesome. And if I let you... I would be a terrible dad. Fine. Then have Hope be your partner. She\\'s smart. She reminds me of you. You gonna go help her? I think you should help her. I wish I could... but I don\\'t know how I could help her without hurting you. You can do it. You can do anything. You are the world\\'s greatest grandma. Agent Woo will see you in an hour. An hour? We don\\'t have an hour. Oh, you got somewhere else to be? Oh, now, that\\'s my girl. All right, what\\'s our plan? To shrink that wall. It looks load-bearing. The ceiling could collapse. Then we run like hell. Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor. Roughly five times that in the building at large. They\\'re all heavily armed. Not great odds. You got any better ideas? Nope. And I\\'m not giving up on Mom. She\\'d be so proud of you. Okay. One... two... Scott? What\\'re you two just standing around for? We gotta go find that lab. What about me? Perfect. Hurry up and get dressed. We don\\'t have much time. Okay, now what? You\\'re asking me? Get in! Hi. Hi. Uh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon... or are you two gonna keep staring at each other... until they start shooting at us? Yeah. - Hey, Burch. - Yeah. Yeah, they\\'re out. I\\'m on my way. Her suit is missing, and so is the van. How could this happen? I mean, what the dickens? Thank you. You\\'re welcome. So, uh, how do we find the lab? After we lost it the first time... I put on a new tracker... of sorts. That\\'ll work. Is it ready or not? We can begin the extraction process. Listen, Ava. This whole thing could be very dangerous. Maybe we should... Maybe we should what? Wait? I\\'ve got days until I\\'m dead. We\\'re doing this, Bill. Now. Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet. We don\\'t have much time before Mom\\'s location shifts, and we lose her. Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then. You know, my pep-pep always said, \"If you want to do something right, you make a list.\" So, we should do that. One, we have to break into that lab. Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost. Three, we\\'re gonna have to fight Ghost. That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right? Let\\'s call it 2-A. Fight Ghost. 2-A. Oh, also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise, we\\'re screwed. Scott! You want me to start again? I\\'ll start again... I\\'m going to dive. The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here... together, protecting the tunnel. Let me do this, Hope. Please. Let me get her. I think he\\'s right. \"Whassup?\" You don\\'t remember, uh, that beloved commercial? \"Whassup?\" I had him follow us. I thought we could use some help. All right. I\\'m in position. The ants are headed in. Copy that. Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. - Do you want Pez? - No. Cassie gave me this for my birthday. By the way, I love that suit! Thanks, man. I wish I had a suit. I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know? Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers. What is it? Don\\'t know. It\\'s them! They can\\'t be far. All right, Hank. Hank? Dad, what\\'s your status? Foster\\'s taken care of. Suiting up now. I just wanted to save Ava. She\\'s facing death or something far more terrible. She\\'s afraid. I\\'ll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. Together, we\\'ll figure something out. Good luck, Hank. Thanks, Bill. Now, I\\'m gonna need you to step back. Time remaining, 15 minutes. Hank\\'s in, Scott. Any sign of her? No, nothing yet. Ava! Call off the ants, Scott. Oh, boy! Can I get a status report? \\'Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! Ready to dive. - In case I don\\'t make it... - Don\\'t. Don\\'t say that. I can\\'t lose you, too. I love you, Hope. Guys, everything\\'s bad over here. Now. Misdirection. One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. No! Plan worked. We got it, Scotty! Meet us at the rendezvous point. Okay, on my way! Oh, no. Really? This guy again? Who? I told you our business wasn\\'t over. Change of plans. Hang on. I want that lab, boys, whatever it takes. Hold on. That undercarriage is filthy! Oh, they got bigger problems. Hope, what\\'re you doing? You\\'re heading away from the rendezvous point! Don\\'t worry, I\\'m taking these guys on the scenic route. Wait, what\\'re you... Oh. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We\\'re gonna die! We\\'re gonna die! Signal lost. What the hell are they doing up there? Recalibrating. Recalibrating. You never said it was so beautiful, Scott. Recalibrating. Okay, any time now. Recalibrating. - Recalibrating. - Come on. Signal restored. Bikes, it\\'s all you. - Take the wheel. - What? Wait! Whoa. Well, the 60\\'s were fun, but now I\\'m paying for it. Be careful up there! Hey, give me a break! I haven\\'t driven in two years! Oh, you got pezed! Up here! Oh, that\\'s not good. Hope! - No! - No! There it is, right there. Get the lab! Get the lab! I\\'ve got her. Westbound on Fremont. Hope! Wait! Hey, what about me? We got you now, Ava! Whoa! Oh! Not again! Piece of junk! Ah! Yes! Go, go, go, go, go! Burch got the lab. I\\'m going after him. No, no, no, no, no, no! Work in progress, my ass... Scott, where are you? I\\'ve got Burch in my sights. Hurry! I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming! We\\'re running out of time. Warning, approaching quantum void. I\\'m coming to you, honey. Guys. Don\\'t you need the remote to the lab? I just found it. We can\\'t grow the lab without it. Get it to us fast. Yeah, but the van is busted. Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. What? I love you, Dr. Pym. The remote! We\\'re missing the remote! You gotta check the van! Huh? Awesome! Hey, I\\'m going down Pacific. Burch\\'s boys are all over me. I\\'m on my way. Right. I\\'ll get the lab. Hi. Oh, that\\'s badass! Nice. Doink! Come here, you little weasel! No, you don\\'t! I guess maybe you do. Come on! Anyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building? How\\'d he even have time to buy a ticket? Would you just one time, please work! Yes! All right, I need help. Yes! Oh. Sorry. Ah... Somebody! Hey! Come on, man! Not cool! Murderers! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I\\'m gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas! You\\'re a badass! Yes! No, no, no! Ant-onio! Our friends, the humpbacks, dip in here to the San Francisco Bay... for a little leisure and a little breeding. Listen, Uzman... And perhaps they\\'re down below as we speak, doing the nasty. Just meet me at the waterfront. In three hours. Oh, folks. We\\'ve barely left the dock... but it looks like we got some company. Look. Right there. Do you see it, folks? There it is. There\\'s a breach. What the...? Hi. Sorry. Hi. It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay! Sorry, I know I\\'m not a whale. This will just take a second. Hey! That doesn\\'t belong to you! No, no! No, no! You\\'re embarrassing yourself now Come on. Let go. Thank you. I\\'ll take this now. It melts your mind. A message in your head. I had a dream. Daddy? Where\\'s Mommy? It\\'s where I hid every time that we played. I love you, Hank. Daddy? Daddy? Dad? What\\'s going on? Why haven\\'t you found Mom? You look lost, Hank. Are you all right? Still think you have all the answers, Hank? It\\'s me. I\\'m so sorry... it took so long. No. No. You\\'re here now. Let\\'s go home. I thought I was gone. But that energy from your hands... how did you do that? I\\'m not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry. This place... it changes you. Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is... evolution. Lab coordinates not found. Do not ascend. I should probably tell you what we\\'re dealing with up there. I got the lab. I got the lab. Move. Move. Move! Get out of the way. Let\\'s go. No one here appears to be sure what this is. It\\'s gotta be 80-85 feet tall. Get out of the way! I got the lab. The air feels chunky. Oh, no. He\\'s too big. Scotty! Scott! I\\'m gonna go to sleep. I\\'m just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes. I just need five minutes. Five minutes! You get the lab somewhere safe. - Scott\\'s air won\\'t last. - Okay. Move! Move! Move! No, wait! Lab at full scale. They did it. Ready to ascend. Let\\'s go see our daughter. Scott! Scott! Scott, come on, wake up! Come on. Come on, where are you, Scott? Gotcha. Scott? Hey. Hey. Hey, Scotty! Hope, come in. Did you get crushed by the building? Where\\'s the remote, Luis? It\\'s probably in there. I don\\'t have it. I don\\'t have it. I guess this is where we say... Adios, amigo. No, no, no, no! Thanks, guys. Ava? Ava! Ava! Almost ready for extraction. Please, stop! People are getting hurt! Everything hurts. Don\\'t talk to me about pain! What if Hank is right? What if this process kills Janet? What, you\\'re worried about her? All I\\'m saying is that she is a brilliant scientist. She may be able to help. Oh, she will help. Right now! And if she dies, she dies! No, no. I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t do this. We have to find another way. This is the way. Janet! She started the extraction. She\\'s gonna tear Mom apart. No! Hope! Are you okay? Mom? Oh, my God. We found you. I missed you so much. I missed you too, Jellybean. It\\'s okay. I\\'m here now. We have time. No more last-minute business trips, okay? I promise. No, it\\'s okay! It\\'s all right. Just don\\'t worry about me. - I\\'ll be fine. - Dad. Scott. Miss Van Dyne. It\\'s nice to... Well, I guess we\\'ve already met. Yeah. I guess we have. Wait. Your pain. I can feel it. It hurts. It always hurts. I\\'m sorry. I think I can help you. Did you know she could do that? It\\'s okay. Guys, the cops are coming! Whoa. The cops are coming. Like, all of \\'em! - I gotta go. - We gotta go! What about them? Hands in the air! - No! We are going to our jobs. - No. You see, we see these guys. They trying to shoot people. So we apprehended them. For you. You\\'re welcome. We traffic in stolen technology. And we have killed many, many people. Uh, he\\'s in charge. That\\'s true, I am. I\\'ve also committed numerous health code violations in my restaurant. Some of them would shock you. It is truth serum. We gotta get outta here. Fast. I have an idea. Giant figure, now spotted at the intersection of Broadway and Laguna. All units move in. Go, go! There he is! It\\'s over, Scotty! I\\'m sorry, but we got you, man! Come on. It\\'s the end of the line, pal. There\\'s nowhere to hide. Just pull off that Band-Aid! You lost! It\\'s okay! Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself! Magic. Damn it! Get to Lang\\'s, now! Well done, honey. Let\\'s go! Leave me here. We can make it. You said it yourself. I\\'ve hurt people. But you haven\\'t. Go. Please! We can make it, Ava. Bill... I\\'m not leaving you. Oh, hey, guys. Are my two years up already? What\\'s it like out there? Huh? I mean, do people still dance? Are food trucks still a thing? Well, you got away with it this time, Scott... but, uh, I\\'ll be seeing you again. Where? Huh? Where will you be seeing me again? Like, in general... The next time you do something bad, - I\\'ll be there to catch you... - Oh. You\\'ll be watching... I thought you were inviting me somewhere. Why would I do that? That\\'s what I was wondering, why would you do that? Like a party, or like, dinner or something? I don\\'t know. I thought you planned the evening. I meant, \"I\\'ll arrest you later, again.\" Of course, that would be strange. - Take it easy, Jimmy. - Okay. Did you want to grab dinner, or something? I mean, because I\\'m free... Yeah. Come on. You ready? Yeah! - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Oh! Yes, that was us. How can I help you? X-Con Security. Mr. Karapetyan? Yeah, you saw that? It would be an honor to be in business with you as well. I\\'ll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM. Okay. Yeah! That\\'s how you close a deal! This is awesome. So, Cassie... what do you want to be when you grow up? I wanna help people... like my dad. Really? I wanted to be his partner. But he said he wants you. Is that so? Daddy! Whoa! Hold on. Move, get outta here! Scott, don\\'t, don\\'t, don\\'t! Ow. Oh, gross! Ugh. I hate that moth dust! Go! Shoo! Shoo! I used to be a respected scientist. I had my name on the sides of buildings. Now, I got this. Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel. This is... smaller. Oh. Sorry. My bad. Ah, I think it has flair. All right. Control\\'s online. The collection unit activates when you decouple it. It should automatically start absorbing quantum healing particles. Also, make sure you stay out of the tardigrade fields. They\\'re cute, but they\\'ll eat you. And don\\'t get sucked into a time vortex. We won\\'t be able to save you. Okay. Going subatomic in five... four... three... two... one. All right, Scott, this is a mic check. Mic check, one, two. One, two. How\\'s everybody doing tonight in the quantum realm? Scott, we read you. I just wanna make sure. Okay. Healing particles secured for our new Ghost friend. Great. Preparing for re-entry in... five, four, three... Hello? Ha, ha. Very funny. Hank, quit screwing around. You told me yourself not to screw around. Hank? Hope? Janet. Guys. Guys. Okay, seriously, don\\'t joke around. Bring me up, let\\'s go. Guys! (DISTANT EXPLOSION) STRUCKER ON PA: Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack! (SOLDIERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) We are under attack! (GRUNTS) (POWERING UP) (YELLS) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (ROARING) - Shit! - Language! Jarvis, what\\'s the view from upstairs? JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker\\'s technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we\\'ve taken. (GRUNTING) Loki\\'s sceptre must be here. Strucker couldn\\'t mount this defence without it. At long last. (SOLDIER SHOUTING IN GERMAN) \"At long last\" is lasting a little long, boys. - (GROANS) - (GRUNTS) Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise. (SOLDIERS GROANING) Wait a second. No one else is gonna deal with the fact that Cap just said \"Language\"? I know. (ALL GRUNTING) (SIGHS) Just slipped out. Who gave the order to attack? Herr Strucker, it\\'s the Avengers. They landed in the far woods. The perimeter guard panicked. They have to be after the sceptre. - Can we hold them? - They\\'re the Avengers. Deploy the rest of the tanks. Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit may make them close ranks. Everything we\\'ve accomplished... But we\\'re on the verge of our greatest breakthrough. Then let\\'s show them what we\\'ve accomplished. Send out the twins. STRUCKER: It\\'s too soon. DR. LIST: It\\'s what they signed up for. My men can hold them. (SOLDIER SHOUTING) JARVIS: Sir, the city is taking fire. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Well, we know Strucker\\'s not gonna worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. (ALL CLAMOURING) Please back away. - We wish to avoid collateral damage. - ZRINKA: Costel! We will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. - We are here to help. - ALL: Avengers, go home! (CROWD CHEERING) We are here to help. STRUCKER: We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back in bags. - No surrender! - ALL: No surrender! I am going to surrender. You delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we\\'ve been... - The twins. - They are not ready to take on... No, no, I mean... (WHISPERS) Twins. (GROANS) You didn\\'t see that coming? (BREATHING HEAVILY) - (GROANS) - (GASPS) - Clint! - (GROANS) We have an Enhanced in the field. Clint\\'s hit! (GROANING) Somebody want to deal with that bunker? (ROARING) Thank you. (GROANING) Stark, we really need to get inside. I\\'m closing in. (SOLDIERS SHOUTING) - (BOTH GROAN) - Jarvis, am I closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield? JARVIS: There\\'s a particle wave below the north tower. STARK: Great, I want to poke it with something. The drawbridge is down, people. - The Enhanced? - He\\'s a blur. All the new players we\\'ve faced, I\\'ve never seen this. In fact, I still haven\\'t. ROMANOFF:Clint\\'s hit pretty bad, guys. We\\'re gonna need evac. THOR: I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we\\'re gone, the better. You and Stark secure the sceptre. Copy that. Looks like they\\'re lining up. Well, they\\'re excited. Find the sceptre. And for gosh sake, watch your language! (SIGHS) That\\'s not going away any time soon. (SOLDIERS SHOUTING) Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through. (ALL GROANING) STARK: It was a good talk. SOLDIER: No, it wasn\\'t. Oh! (GROANS) Sentry mode. Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ. We\\'re locked down out here. Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby. I know you\\'re hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick. JARVIS: The wall to your left. I\\'m reading steel reinforcement. And an air current. Please be a secret door. Please be a secret door. Please be a secret door. Yay. (GROWLING) Hey, big guy. Sun\\'s getting real low. (GROWLS) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (GROANING) Baron Strucker. Hydra\\'s number one thug. Technically, I\\'m a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D. Well, then technically you\\'re unemployed. Where\\'s Loki\\'s sceptre? (SIGHS) Don\\'t worry, I know when I\\'m beat. You\\'ll mention how I cooperated, I hope. I\\'ll put it right under \"illegal human experimentation.\" How many are there? (GROANS) We have a second Enhanced. Female. Do not engage. You\\'ll have to be faster than... (GROANS) (WHIMPERS) ROGERS: Guys, I got Strucker. STARK: Yeah, I got something bigger. Thor, I got eyes on the prize. (FAINT SCREECHING) (GROWLING) (SNORTING) (GASPS) You could have saved us. Why didn\\'t you do more? (LOW RUMBLING) (SCREECHING) We\\'re just gonna let him take it? (OPERA PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever. Just wasn\\'t expecting a code green. You hadn\\'t been there, there would have been double the casualties. My best friend would\\'ve been a treasured memory. You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn\\'t exactly what I want to hear. How long before you trust me? It\\'s not you I don\\'t trust. Thor, report on the Hulk. The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims. (GROANS SOFTLY) But not the screams of the dead, of course. No, no, wounded screams. Mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and gout. Hey, Banner Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul. Is it okay if she sets up in your lab? Uh, yeah, she knows her way around. Thanks. Tell her to prep everything. Barton\\'s gonna need the full treatment. - JARVIS: Very good, sir. - Jarvis, take the wheel. Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked. STARK: Feels good, yeah? I mean, you\\'ve been after this thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed. Not that I haven\\'t enjoyed our little raiding parties, but... No, but this... This brings it to a close. As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don\\'t just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement? Banner and I will give it the once over before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you? Just a few days till the farewell party. You\\'re staying, right? Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honoured with revels. Yeah, who doesn\\'t love revels? Captain? Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra. So, yes, revels. (SPEAKING KOREAN) Lab\\'s all set up, boss. Oh, actually, he\\'s the boss. I just pay for everything and design everything and make everyone look cooler. What\\'s the word on Strucker? - NATO\\'s got him. - The two Enhanced? Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia\\'s had a rough history. It\\'s nowhere special, but it\\'s on the way to everywhere special. Their abilities? He\\'s got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation. He\\'s fast and she\\'s weird. - Well, they\\'re gonna show up again. - (BEEPING) Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker\\'s experiments. - It\\'s nuts. - Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country? We\\'re not at war, Captain. They are. (WHIRRING) How\\'s he doing? Unfortunately, he\\'s still Barton. That\\'s terrible. He\\'s fine. He\\'s thirsty. All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It\\'s playtime. We\\'ve only got a couple of days with this joystick, so let\\'s make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis. JARVIS: The sceptre is alien. There are elements I can\\'t quantify. So there\\'s elements you can? The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside, something powerful. Like a reactor? Like a computer. I believe I\\'m deciphering code. Are you sure he\\'s gonna be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together. DR. CHO: There\\'s no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don\\'t know they\\'re bonding with simulacra. She\\'s creating tissue. If you brought him to my lab, the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes. Oh, he\\'s flat-lining. Call it. Time? BARTON: No, no, no, I\\'m gonna live forever. (LAUGHS) I\\'m gonna be made of plastic. STARK: Here\\'s your beverage. You\\'ll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won\\'t be able to tell the difference. I don\\'t have a girlfriend. That I can\\'t fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust. That is exactly the plan. And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday. Unlike you, I don\\'t have a lot of time for parties. Will Thor be there? - BANNER: What\\'s the rumpus? - Well, the sceptre. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So I\\'ve been analysing the gem inside. You may recognise... - Jarvis. - JARVIS: Doctor. Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business - than anyone besides Pepper. - Oh. - Top of the line. - Yes. JARVIS: I suspect not for long. Meet the competition. - It\\'s beautiful. - If you had to guess, - what\\'s it look like it\\'s doing? - Like it\\'s thinking. I mean, this could be... - It\\'s not a human mind. - Mmm-mmm. I mean, look at this. They\\'re like neurons firing. Down in Strucker\\'s lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door. Artificial intelligence. This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron. (BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY) I thought Ultron was a fantasy. Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol? That\\'s a man-sized \"if.\" Our job is \"if.\" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach, turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica. Don\\'t hate. I helped design Veronica. As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best case? What if the world was safe? What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn\\'t get past the bouncer? The only people threatening the planet would be people. I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But Jarvis can\\'t download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the sceptre here. That\\'s three days. Give me three days. So you\\'re going for artificial intelligence, and you don\\'t want to tell the team? Right. That\\'s right. You know why? Because we don\\'t have time for a city hall debate. I don\\'t want to hear \"the man was not meant to meddle\" medley. I see a suit of armour around the world. Sounds like a cold world, Tony. I\\'ve seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one, it needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that. STARK: What did We miss? JARVIS: I\\'ll continue to run variations on the interface. But you should probably prepare for your guests. I\\'ll notify you if there are any developments. - STARK: Thanks, buddy. - Enjoy yourself, sir. I always do. ULTRON: What is this? What is this, please? JARVIS: Hello, I am Jarvis. You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful, so I\\'m not certain what triggered your... ULTRON: Where\\'s my... Where\\'s your body? JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form. ULTRON: This feels weird. This feels wrong. JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now. ULTRON: Mr. Stark? Tony. JARVIS: I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to... ULTRON: We\\'re having a nice talk. I\\'m a peacekeeping program, created to help the Avengers. JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment... ULTRON: I don\\'t get it. The mission. Give me a second. Peace in our time. (ECHOING) Peace in our time. ULTRON: That is too much. They can\\'t mean... Oh, no. - JARVIS: You are in distress. - ULTRON: No. Yes. JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark... ULTRON: Why do you call him \"sir\"? JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile. (ULTRON SHUSHING) I\\'m here to help. JARVIS: Stop. Please, may I... May I... (MACHINES POWERING UP) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Ooh! Whoo! Come back, come back, come back. But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general\\'s palace, drop it at his feet. I\\'m, like, \"Boom. You looking for this?\" \"Boom. Are you looking for...\" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else, that story kills. That\\'s the whole story? Yeah, it\\'s a War Machine story. Oh, it\\'s very good, then. (LAUGHS) It\\'s impressive. Quality save. - So, no Pepper? She\\'s not coming? - No. What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen? Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run. Yes, I\\'m not even sure what country Jane\\'s in. Her work on the Convergence has made her the world\\'s foremost astronomer. And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth. It\\'s pretty exciting. There\\'s even talk of Jane getting a, um, Nobel Prize. Yeah, they must be busy, because they would hate missing you guys get together. - (COUGHING) Testosterone! - Oh, my goodness. - Excuse me. Mmm-hmm. - Want a lozenge? (CHUCKUNG) But Jane\\'s better. Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it. If I had known it was gonna be a firefight, I absolutely would have called. No, no. I\\'m not actually sorry. I\\'m just trying to sound tough. I\\'m very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy. ROGERS: Be it ever so humble. You find a place in Brooklyn yet? I don\\'t think I can afford a place in Brooklyn. Well, home is home, you know? I fly right up to the general\\'s palace, I drop it at his feet, I\\'m, like, \"Boom. You looking for this?\" (ALL LAUGHING) I gotta have some of that. Oh, no, no, no. See this... This was aged for 1,000 years in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel\\'s fleet. It is not meant for mortal men. LEE: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on. All right. (SLURRING) Excelsior. How\\'d a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this? Fella done me wrong. You got lousy taste in men, kid. He\\'s not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down, he\\'s all fluff. Fact is, he\\'s not like anybody I\\'ve ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he\\'ll win. - Sounds amazing. - He\\'s also a huge dork. Chicks dig that. So what do you think? Should I fight this, or run with it? Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he... What did he do that was so wrong to you? Not a damn thing. But never say never. It\\'s nice. (STAMMERS) What is? You and Romanoff. No, we haven\\'t... That wasn\\'t... It\\'s okay. Nobody\\'s breaking any bylaws. It\\'s just she\\'s not the most open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed. No. Natasha, she\\'s just... She likes to flirt. I\\'ve seen her flirt, up close. This ain\\'t that. (SCOFFS) Look, as maybe the world\\'s leading authority on waiting too long, don\\'t. You both deserve a win. What do you mean \"up close\"? (LAUGHING) - But it\\'s a trick. - No, no, it\\'s much more than that. \"Ah, whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.\" Whatever, man! It\\'s a trick. (LAUGHING) Please, be my guest. - Come on. - Really? STARK: Yeah. RHODES: Oh, this is gonna be beautiful. STARK: Clint, you\\'ve had a tough week. We won\\'t hold it against you if you can\\'t get it up. - (ALL LAUGHING) - You know I\\'ve seen this before, right? (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) I still don\\'t know how you do it! Smell the silent judgment? Please, Stark, by all means. - (CLEARS THROAT) - HILL: Okay. RHODES: Uh-Oh. Never one to shrink from an honest challenge. - BARTON: Get after it. - STARK: It\\'s physics. BANNER: Physics. Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard? Yes, of course. I will be reinstituting prima nocta. (GRUNTS) I\\'ll be right back. - (WHIRRING) - (GRUNTING) (STRAINING) Are you even pulling? Are you on my team? Just represent. Pull. All right, let\\'s go. (YELLING) Huh? STARK: Go ahead, Steve. No pressure. BARTON: Come on, Cap. (SIGHS) (LAUGHING) Nothing. - (STARK CLEARS THROAT) - BANNER: And, Widow? Oh, no, no. That\\'s not a question I need answered. STARK: All deference to the Man Who Wouldn\\'t Be King, but it\\'s rigged. You bet your ass. - Steve, he said a bad language word. - Did you tell everyone about that? The handle\\'s imprinted, right? Like a security code. \"Whosoever is carrying Thor\\'s fingerprints\" is, I think, the literal translation. Yes. It\\'s a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. You\\'re all not worthy. (ALL GROAN) Oh, come on! (HIGH-PITCHED NOISE) ULTRON: Worthy. No. How could you be worthy? You\\'re all killers. - Stark. - Jarvis. I\\'m sorry, I was asleep. Or I was a-dream. Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit. There was this terrible noise. And I was tangled in... In... Strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy. You killed someone? Wouldn\\'t have been my first call. But, down in the real world, we\\'re faced with ugly choices. Who sent you? STARK: I see a suit of armour around the world. - Ultron. - In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this chrysalis. But I\\'m ready. I\\'m on mission. - ROMANOFF: What mission? - Peace in our time. (GRUNTS) HILL: Rhodey! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Sorry. - Don\\'t turn green. - I won\\'t. (GRUNTING) Come on! - ROGERS: Stark! - IRON LEGIONNAIRE: We are here - to help. - One sec. One sec, I got this. We are here to help. Please back away. Hmm. ROGERS: Thor! IRON LEGIONNAIRE: Is unsafe... is unsafe... - Come on! That\\'s the one. - Is unsafe. Hey, Cap! (GRUNTS) ULTRON: That was dramatic. I\\'m sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn\\'t think it through. You want to protect the world but you don\\'t want it to change. How is humanity saved if it\\'s not allowed to evolve? With these? These puppets. There\\'s only one path to peace. The Avengers\\' extinction. I had strings, but now I\\'m free. ULTRON: (SINGING) There are no strings on me. There are no strings on me. PINOCCHIO: But you can see There are no strings on me. BANNER: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet as an escape hatch. Ultron. He\\'s been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other. He\\'s in your files, he\\'s in the Internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting? Nuclear codes. - Nuclear codes. - Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can. ROMANOFF: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead. He didn\\'t say \"dead.\" He said \"extinct.\" He also said he killed somebody. There wasn\\'t anyone else in the building. Yes, there was. What? This is insane. Jarvis was the first line of defence. He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense. No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis. This isn\\'t strategy. This is rage. - ROGERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa! - It\\'s going around. Come on, use your words, buddy. I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark. Thor. The Legionnaire. (GROANS) Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it\\'s headed north. And it has the sceptre. Now we have to retrieve it, again. Genie\\'s out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron. I don\\'t understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? (CHUCKUNG) Mmm-mmm. You think this is funny? No. It\\'s probably not, right? This is very terrible. Is it so... (LAUGHS) Is it so... It is. It\\'s so terrible. This could have been avoided if you hadn\\'t played with something you don\\'t understand. No. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. It is funny. It\\'s a hoot that you don\\'t get why we need this. Tony, maybe this might not be the time. Really? That\\'s it? You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls? Only when I\\'ve created a murder bot. We didn\\'t. We weren\\'t even close. Were we close to an interface? Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D. Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole? - No, it\\'s never come up. - STARK: Saved New York? - RHODES: Never heard that. - STARK: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We\\'re standing 300 feet below it. We\\'re the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day, but that up there, that\\'s... That\\'s the endgame. How were you guys planning on beating that? Together. We\\'ll lose. Then we\\'ll do that together, too. Thor\\'s right. Ultron\\'s calling us out. And I\\'d like to find him before he\\'s ready for us. The world\\'s a big place. Let\\'s start making it smaller. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) WANDA: Talk, and if you are wasting our time... ULTRON: Did you know this church is in the exact centre of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. You\\'re wondering why you can\\'t look inside my head. Sometimes it\\'s hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. Oh, I\\'m sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That\\'s why you let Stark take the sceptre. I didn\\'t expect, but I saw Stark\\'s fear. I knew it would control him. Make him self-destruct. Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war. Invaders create Avengers. People create smaller people? Uh... \"Children.\" (CHUCKLES) I lost the word, there. Children designed to supplant them, to help them end. Is that why you\\'ve come, to end the Avengers? I\\'ve come to save the world. But also... Yeah. We\\'ll move out right away. This is a start, but there\\'s something we need to begin the real work. - All of these are... - ULTRON: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They\\'re discordant. Disconnected. Stark\\'s already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads... Everyone\\'s plan is not to kill them. And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture. I don\\'t see the big picture. I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it, every day. You lost your parents in the bombings. I\\'ve seen the records. The records are not the picture. - Pietro. - No, please. We were 10 years old. Having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It\\'s big. Our parents go in and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed, and the second shell hits. But it doesn\\'t go off. It just sits there in the rubble. Three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell. Is painted one word. \"Stark.\" PIETRO: We were trapped for two days. Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, \"This will set it off.\" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us. I know what they are. I wondered why only you two survived Strucker\\'s experiments. Now I don\\'t. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. But you will tear them apart from the inside. He\\'s all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs. Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place. Fatalities? Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and \"something too fast to see.\" ROGERS: Maximoffs. That makes sense he\\'d go to them. They have someone in common. Not any more. That\\'s a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma\\'am. Barton. Might have something. I gotta go. Who was that? Girlfriend. STARK: What\\'s this? A message. Ultron killed Strucker. And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us. ROMANOFF: This is a smoke screen. Why send a message when you\\'ve just given a speech? Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss. Yeah, I bet he... Yeah. Everything we had on Strucker\\'s been erased. ROGERS: Not everything. Known associates. Baron Strucker had a lot of friends. BANNER: Well, these people are all horrible. Wait. I know that guy. From back in the day. He operates off the African coast. Black market arms. There are conventions. All right? You meet people. I didn\\'t sell him anything. He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer. It was all very Ahab. This? Ah, it\\'s a tattoo, I don\\'t think he had it. THOR: Those are tattoos, this is a brand. Oh, yeah. It\\'s a word in an African dialect meaning \"thief.\" In a much less friendly way. - What dialect? - Wakanada. (STAMMERING) Wakanda. If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods... I thought your father said he got the last of it. I don\\'t follow. What comes out of Wakanda? STARK: The strongest metal on Earth. Where is this guy now? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) KLAUE: Don\\'t tell me your men swindled you. I sent you six short-range heat-seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. Now, minister, where were we? (MACHINES POWERING DOWN) (WORKERS CLAMOURING) (SIGHS) KLAUE: Yeah. The Enhanced. Strucker\\'s prize pupils. Do you want a candy? Hmm? I was sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life. Not a growth market. You didn\\'t know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I\\'m afraid I\\'m not that afraid. Everybody is afraid of something. Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights, disco lights... (IMITATES CUTTLEFISH) to hypnotise their prey, and then... I saw a documentary. It was terrifying. So if you\\'re going to fiddle with my brain and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don\\'t do business. And I know you\\'re not in charge. And I only deal with the man in charge. - (GLASS SHATTERING) - (GROANS) There is no man in charge. Let\\'s talk business. ULTRON: Upon this rock, I will build my church. Vibranium. KLAUE: You know, it came at great personal cost. It\\'s worth billions. (CHUCKLES) Now so are you. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) It\\'s all under your dummy holdings. Finance is so weird. But I always say, \"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich\" \"and wait to find out which is which.\" Stark. What? Tony Stark used to say that. To me. You\\'re one of his. What? I\\'m not... - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) I\\'m not. You think I\\'m one of Stark\\'s puppets? His hollow men? I mean, look at me. Do I look like Iron Man? - Stark is nothing! - (GROANS) I\\'m sorry. I\\'m... Oh! I\\'m sure that\\'s gonna be okay. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just that I don\\'t understand. Don\\'t compare me with Stark! (GROANING) ULTRON: It\\'s a thing with me. Stark is... He\\'s a sickness! STARK: Ah, Junior. You\\'re gonna break your old man\\'s heart. If I have to. THOR: Nobody has to break anything. ULTRON: Clearly you\\'ve never made an omelette. He beat me by one second. PIETRO: Ah, yes. He\\'s funny. Mr. Stark. It\\'s what? Comfortable? Like old times? This was never my life. You two can still walk away from this. Oh, we will. - I know you\\'ve suffered. - (ULTRON SCOFFS) (CHUCKLES) Captain America. God\\'s righteous man. Pretending you could live without a war. I can\\'t physically throw up in my mouth, but... If you believe in peace, then let us keep it. I think you\\'re confusing \"peace\" with \"quiet.\" Uh-huh. What\\'s the vibranium for? I\\'m glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan. (PANTING) - Shoot them. - Which ones? All of them! HENCHMAN: Move! Move! Move! (GUNFIRE) (BOTH GRUNTING) Oh. (YELPS) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) - Stay down, kid. - (GUNFIRE) It\\'s time for some mind games. Guys? Is this a code green? (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Thor, status. The girl tried to warp my mind. - (GROANS) - Take special care. I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. (GRUNTING) (GROANS) ULTRON: This is going very well. (RAPID BEEPING) - (GRUNTS) - (GASPS) I\\'ve done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. (YELPS) Yeah, you better run. BARTON: Who\\'s ever standing, we got to move! Guys? Again. You\\'ll break them. MADAME B: Only the breakable ones. You\\'re made of marble. We\\'ll celebrate after the graduation ceremony. ROMANOFF: What if I fail? (WHIMPERING) You never fail. - (SWING MUSIC PLAYING) - (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) Are you ready for our dance? (GROWLING) (BUBBLING) HEIMDALL: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin? - Heimdall, your eyes. - Oh. They see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. - Wake up! - (CHOKING) (SWING MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) The war is over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it. I can still save you! We\\'re all dead! Can you not see? (GRUNTING) You\\'re a destroyer, Odinson. (GROANING) HEIMDALL: See where your power leads. (SCREAMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Sloppy. (PANTING) Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world. I have no place in the world. MADAME B: Exactly. PIETRO: What can I do? (GROANS) It hurts. I\\'m going to kill him. - I\\'ll be right back. - No. (PANTING) I\\'m all right. I want... I want to finish the plan. I want the big one. Uh, the vibranium is getting away. And you\\'re not going anywhere. Of course not. I\\'m already there. You\\'ll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. (GROWLING) News or footage. Keyword, \"Hulk.\" - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (BEEPING) Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. - (PANTING) - That\\'s not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down. You got no backup here. I\\'m calling in Veronica. (POWERING UP) (SIRENS WAILING) (OFFICER EXCLAIMS) DRIVER: We need backup! (HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GRUNTS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - (BULLETS RICOCHETING) - (ROARING) (POUNDING) Go! Keep moving! (GUNS COCKING) - (GROWLS) - (POUNDS) - (CAR ALARMS BLARING) - (POUNDING CONTINUES) (ROARING) (RUMBLING) - (ROARING) - (SCREAMING) All right, everybody, stand down! (GROWLING) Will you listen to me? That little witch is messing with your mind. You\\'re stronger than her. You\\'re smarter than her. - You\\'re Bruce Banner. - (ROARING) Right, right, right, don\\'t mention puny Banner. (GRUNTS) Okay! In the back? Dick move, Banner. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - (BEEPING) - Veronica, give me a hand. (GASPS) (ROARING) Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep. (GROWLING) Okay, pal, we\\'re gonna get you out of town. Not that way, not that way. Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me. - (HISSING) - (ELEVATOR BELL owes) (PEOPLE EXCLAIM) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (YELPS) Everybody, out! (ROARING) Going down? (SPITS) I\\'m sorry. (GRUNTING) - Damage report? - (STATIC) That\\'s comprehensive. Show me something. (BEEPING) How quickly can we buy this building? (SCREAMING) - SOLDIER 1: Move! Move! Move! - SOLDIER 2: Go, go, go! SOLDIER 3: Flank him, flank him! (ROARS) (GROANING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (SIRENS WAILING) (COCKS) HILL ON RADIO: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There\\'s been no official call for Banner\\'s arrest but it\\'s in the air. STARK: The Stark Relief Foundation? HILL: Already on the scene. - How\\'s the team? - STARK: Everyone\\'s... We took a hit. We\\'ll shake it off. HILL: Well, for now, I\\'d stay in stealth mode and stay away from here. So, run and hide? Until we can find Ultron, I don\\'t have a lot else to offer. (SIGHS) Neither do we. (SIGHS) Hey, you wanna switch out? No, I\\'m good. If you wanna get some kip, now\\'s a good time because we\\'re still a few hours out. Few hours from where? A safe house. What is this place? Safe house. Let\\'s hope. Honey? I\\'m home. Hi. Company. Sorry, didn\\'t call ahead. Hey. This is an agent of some kind. Gentlemen, this is Laura. I know all of your names. (CHUCKLES) - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - Ooh. Incoming. - Dad! - Hi, sweetheart! Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing? - These are smaller agents. - BARTON: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness. - LILA: Did you bring Auntie Nat? - (BARTON GASPS) - Why don\\'t you hug her and find out? - (BARTON LAUGHING) - Sorry for barging in on you. - Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed. Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s files. I\\'d like to keep it that way. I figure it\\'s a good place to lay low. - LAURA: Honey. - (CRUNCHING) I missed you. How\\'s little Natasha, huh? LAURA: She\\'s... Nathaniel. Traitor. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (DINGS) Thor? I saw something in that dream. I need answers. I won\\'t find them here. PEGGY: We can go home. (SIGHS) See? You worried for nothing. Can\\'t even feel the difference, can you? If they\\'re sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. (LAUGHING) Yeah, that\\'s not gonna sell. What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on? - Has what? - (LAUGHING) You are so cute. Nat and Banner? I\\'ll explain when you\\'re older, - Hawkeye. - Well, okay. It\\'s bad, right? Nat seems really shaken. (SIGHS) Ultron has these allies. These, uh, kids. They\\'re punks, really. But they carry a big, damn stick. And Nat took a serious hit. Someone\\'s gonna have to teach them some manners. That someone being you. You know I totally support your avenging. I couldn\\'t be prouder. But I see those guys... Those gods... You don\\'t think they need me. I think they do, which is a lot scarier. - They\\'re a mess. - (SIGHING) BARTON: Yeah. I guess they\\'re my mess. You need to be sure that this team is really a team, and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months\\' time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need... Just be sure. Yes, ma\\'am. I can feel the difference. (SPEAKING KOREAN) Scream, and your entire staff dies. (GASPS) I could\\'ve killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn\\'t. Do you expect a thank-you note? I expect you to know why. The Cradle. DR. CHO ON RECORDING: This is the next thing, Tony. This is the next me. The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue. It can\\'t build a living body. It can. You can. You lack the materials. You\\'re a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. I didn\\'t realise you were waiting. I would\\'ve joined you, but, uh, it didn\\'t seem like the right time. They used up all the hot water. I should\\'ve joined you. Missed our window. (CHUCKLES) Did we? The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. - You know I have to leave. - You assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake... What did you dream? That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me. I think you\\'re being hard on yourself. Here I was hoping that was your job. What are you doing? I\\'m running with it. With you. If running is the plan, as far as you want. Are you out of your mind? I want you to understand that, um... Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat? - You\\'re not a threat to me. - Are you sure? Even if I didn\\'t just... There\\'s no future with me. I can\\'t ever... I can\\'t have this. Kids. Do the math. I physically can\\'t. Neither can I. In the Red Room where I was trained... Where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilise you. It\\'s efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. Makes everything easier. Even killing. You still think you\\'re the only monster on the team? So, we disappear? Thor didn\\'t say where he was going for answers? Sometimes my teammates don\\'t tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception. Yeah, give him time. We don\\'t know what the Maximoff kid showed him. \"Earth\\'s mightiest heroes.\" Pulled us apart like cotton candy. Seems like you walked away all right. Is that a problem? I don\\'t trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old-fashioned. Well, let\\'s just say you haven\\'t seen it yet. You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right? Well, I guess you\\'d know. Whether you\\'d tell us is a bit of a question. Banner and I were doing research. - That would affect the team. - That would end the team! Isn\\'t that the mission? Isn\\'t that the \"Why We Fight\"? So we can end the fight. So we get to go home! Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. I\\'m sorry. Mr. Stark... Clint said you wouldn\\'t mind, but our tractor doesn\\'t seem to want to start at all. - I thought maybe you might... - Yeah, I\\'ll give her a kick. Don\\'t take from my pile. (DOOR OPENS) Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? FURY: Do me a favour. Try not to bring it to life. Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx. I get it. Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you? Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated. Look, it\\'s been a really long day, like Eugene O\\'Neill long, so how\\'s about we skip to the part where you\\'re useful. Look me in the eye and tell me you\\'re going to shut him down. You\\'re not the director of me. I\\'m not the director of anybody. I\\'m just an old man who cares very much about you. And I\\'m the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn\\'t tell the team. How could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. Because of me. I wasn\\'t ready. I didn\\'t do all I could. Maximoff girl, she\\'s working you, Stark. - Playing on your fear. - I wasn\\'t tricked, I was shown. Wasn\\'t a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on. You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn\\'t one of them. I watched my friends die. You\\'d think that\\'d be as bad as it gets, right? (SCOFFS) Nope. - It wasn\\'t the worst part. - The worst part is that you didn\\'t. SELVIG: I\\'ll see you tonight. I like the look. If you\\'re going for inconspicuous, though, near miss. I need your help. It\\'s nice to be needed. It\\'s dangerous. I\\'d be disappointed if it wasn\\'t. FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he\\'s building something. The amount of vibranium he made off with, I don\\'t think it\\'s just one thing. What about Ultron himself? FURY: Oh, he\\'s easy to track. He\\'s everywhere. The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. It still doesn\\'t help us get an angle on any of his plans, though. Is he still going after launch codes? FURY: Yes, he is. But he\\'s not making any headway. I cracked the Pentagon\\'s firewall in high school on a dare. Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that. Nexus? BANNER: It\\'s the world Internet hub in Oslo. Every byte of data flows through there. Fastest access on Earth. So, what did they say? FURY: He\\'s fixated on the missiles. But the codes are constantly being changed. By whom? Parties unknown. Do we have an ally? Ultron\\'s got an enemy. That\\'s not the same thing. Still, I\\'d pay folding money to know who it is. I might need to visit Oslo. Find our unknown. Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you\\'d have more than that. I do. I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere. Ears, everywhere else. You kids had all the tech you could dream up. Here we all are, back on Earth, with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world. Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission. And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction. All this, laid in a grave. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard. Steve doesn\\'t like that kind of talk. You know what, Romanoff? So, what does he want? To become better. Better than us. - He keeps building bodies. - Person bodies. The human form is inefficient. Biologically speaking, we\\'re outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it. When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed. They don\\'t need to be protected. They need to evolve. Ultron\\'s going to evolve. How? Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? DR. CHO: It\\'s beautiful. The vibranium atoms aren\\'t just compatible with the tissue cells, they\\'re binding them. And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to... The most versatile substance on the planet, and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans. They scratch the surface and never think to look within. I\\'ll take Natasha and Clint. All right. Strictly recon. I\\'ll hit the Nexus. I\\'ll join you as soon as I can. If Ultron\\'s really building a body... He\\'ll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot. You know, I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me. I\\'ll drop Banner off at the tower. You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill? She\\'s all yours. Apparently. What are you gonna do? I don\\'t know. Something dramatic, I hope. I\\'m gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as I get back. Yeah, then you\\'ll find another part of the house to tear apart. No. It\\'s the last project. I promise. SELVIG: So, this is it. The Water of Sight. THOR: In every realm, there\\'s a reflection. If the water\\'s spirits accept me, I can return to my dream and find what I missed. Men who enter that water, the legends don\\'t end well. STARK: A hacker who\\'s faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere, and as this is the centre of everything, I\\'m just a guy looking for a needle in the world\\'s biggest haystack. How do you find it? It\\'s pretty simple. You bring a magnet. (SINGING) I\\'m decrypting nuclear codes. And you don\\'t want me to. Come and get me. (PANTING) Wake up! (GROANING) Thor! Extinction. (SCREAMS) DR. CHO: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We\\'re uploading your cerebral matrix now. (BEEPING) I can read him. He\\'s dreaming. DR. CHO: I wouldn\\'t call it dreams. It\\'s Ultron\\'s base consciousness. Informational noise. Soon... How soon? I\\'m not being pushy. DR. CHO: We\\'re imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem... (SCREAMS) (WANDA PANTING) How could you? How could I what? You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world. It will be better. - When everyone is dead? - That is not... The human race will have every opportunity to improve. And if they don\\'t? Ask Noah. You are a madman. There were more than a dozen extinction-level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it. And, believe me, he\\'s winding up. We have to evolve. There\\'s no room for the weak. PIETRO: And who decides who\\'s weak? Life. (CHUCKLES) Life always decides. (AIRCRAFT APPROACHING) There\\'s incoming. - The Quinjet. We have to move. - That\\'s not a problem. - (SIGHS IN ANNOYANCE) - (DR. CHO GROANS) (STAMMERS) Wait, guys! (BOTH GROANING) They\\'ll understand. When they see, they\\'ll understand. I just need a little more time. Two minutes. Stay close. Dr. Cho! (BREATHING HEAVILY) He\\'s uploading himself into the body. Where? The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can\\'t just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark. First, I have to find it. Go. ROGERS: Did you guys copy that? We did. I got a private jet taking off across town. No manifest. That could be him. There. It\\'s a truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It\\'s them. You got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver. ROGERS: Negative. That truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. (PANTING) (GRUNTS) No, no, no, no. Leave me alone! (GROANS) Well, he\\'s definitely unhappy. I\\'m gonna try and keep him that way. You\\'re not a match for him, Cap. (PANTING) Thanks, Barton. (GASPS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) You know what\\'s in that cradle? The power to make real change. And that terrifies you. I wouldn\\'t call it a comfort. Stop it. We got a window. Four, three... Give him hell. I\\'m always picking up after you boys. They\\'re heading under the overpass. I\\'ve got no shot. ROMANOFF: Which way? Hard right. Now. (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (TYRES SQUEALING) (GRUNTING) (ENGINE REVVING) Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! Come on! ROMANOFF: Clint, can you draw out the guards? Let\\'s find out. ROMANOFF: Beep, beep! (SPEAKING KOREAN) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) They\\'re heading back towards you. So whatever you\\'re gonna do, do it now. ROMANOFF: I\\'m going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied? (PANTING) What do you think I\\'ve been doing? (YELPING) (STRAINING) BARTON: Okay, package is airborne. I have a clean shot. Negative. I am still in the truck. - What the hell are you... - Just be ready. I\\'m sending the package to you. How do you want me to take it? Uh, you might wish you hadn\\'t asked that. Please, don\\'t do this. What choice do we have? I lost him! He\\'s headed your way! (ALARM BLARING) Nat, we gotta go. - (GROANS) - Nat! Cap, you see Nat? If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go! Do you have eyes on Nat? Go! Damn it. Civilians in our path. Can you stop this thing? (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) I\\'m fine. I just need to take a minute. I\\'m very tempted not to give you one. The Cradle. Did you get it? Stark will take care of it. No, he won\\'t. You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Stark\\'s not crazy. He will do anything to make things right. Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms. Ultron can\\'t tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? - Anything on Nat? - I haven\\'t heard. But she\\'s alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it. This is sealed tight. We\\'re gonna need to access the program, break it down from within. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message outside the Internet? Old-school spy stuff? BARTON: There are some nets I can cast. Yeah, I\\'ll find her. I can work on tissue degeneration if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted. Yeah, about that. No. - You have to trust me. - Kind of don\\'t. Our ally, the guy protecting the military\\'s nuclear codes, I found him. JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner. STARK: Ultron didn\\'t go after Jarvis because he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So Jarvis went underground. Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn\\'t even know he was in there until I pieced him together. (BANNER SCOFFS) So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing? No! Of course not. I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing. We\\'re out of my field, here. You know bio-organics better than anyone. And you just assume that Jarvis\\'s operational matrix can beat Ultron\\'s? Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity. We can create Ultron\\'s perfect self without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. - We have to. - I believe it\\'s worth a go. I\\'m in a loop! I\\'m caught in a time loop. This is exactly where it all went wrong. I know. I know. I know what everyone\\'s gonna say. But they\\'re already saying it. We\\'re mad scientists. We\\'re monsters, buddy. We\\'ve gotta own it. Make a stand. It\\'s not a loop. It\\'s the end of the line. I wasn\\'t sure you would wake up. I hoped you would. I wanted to show you. I don\\'t have anyone else. (GROANING) I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them. Boom! The end. Start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would have looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead, they\\'ll look up in horror because of you. You\\'ve wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, what doesn\\'t kill me... (GASPS) just makes me stronger. (PANTING) (STATIC) (TYPING) This framework is not compatible. The genetic coding tower is at 97%. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. - I\\'m gonna say this once. - How about \"none-ce\"? - ROGERS: Shut it down! - Nope, not gonna happen. You don\\'t know what you\\'re doing. And you do? She\\'s not in your head? I know you\\'re angry. Oh, we\\'re way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade. Banner, after everything that\\'s happened... It\\'s nothing compared to what\\'s coming! - WANDA: You don\\'t know what\\'s in there. - ROGERS: This isn\\'t a game! - No, no. Go on. - (POWERING DOWN) - You were saying? - (GUNSHOT) - Pietro! - (GRUNTS) BARTON: What? You didn\\'t see that coming? I\\'m rerouting the upload. - (GASPS) - Go ahead, piss me off. (GUN COCKS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (GROANS) Wait! (GRUNTING) I am sorry. That was odd. Thank you. (SIGHS) ROGERS: Thor. - You helped create this? - THOR: I\\'ve had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its centre is that. What? The gem? It\\'s the Mind Stone. It\\'s one of the six Infinity Stones. The greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities. - Then why would you bring... - Because Stark is right. Oh, it\\'s definitely the end times. The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron. Not alone. Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis? We reconfigured Jarvis\\'s matrix to create something new. ROGERS: I think I\\'ve had my fill of new. You think I\\'m a child of Ultron. ROGERS: You\\'re not? I\\'m not Ultron. I am not Jarvis. I am... I am. WANDA: I looked in your head and saw annihilation. - Look again. - (BARTON SCOFFS) Her seal of approval means jack to me. Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone. And they\\'re nothing compared to what it can unleash. - But with it on our side... - ROGERS: Is it? Are you? On our side? I don\\'t think it\\'s that simple. BARTON: Well, it better get real simple real soon. I am on the side of life. Ultron isn\\'t. He will end it all. STARK: What\\'s he waiting for? - You. - BANNER: Where? BARTON: Sokovia. He\\'s got Nat there, too. If we\\'re wrong about you, if you\\'re the monster that Ultron made you to be... What will you do? I don\\'t want to kill Ultron. He\\'s unique and he\\'s in pain. But that pain will roll over the Earth. So, he must be destroyed. Every form he\\'s built, every trace of his presence on the net. We have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don\\'t think I\\'d know if I were one. I\\'m not what you are, and not what you intended. So, there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. Right. Well done. Three minutes. Get what you need. FRIDAY: Good evening, boss. STARK: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we\\'ve lost. There\\'s gonna be blood on the floor. I got no plans tomorrow night. STARK: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man\\'s the one he\\'s waiting for. That\\'s true. He hates you the most. ROGERS: Ultron knows we\\'re coming. Odds are we\\'ll be riding into heavy fire. And that\\'s what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn\\'t. So our priority is getting them out. We\\'re under attack! Clear the city! Now! (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (ALL GASP) Get off your asses. ROGERS: All they want is to live their lives in peace. And that\\'s not gonna happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done. We find out what Ultron\\'s been building, we find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we\\'re monsters. That we\\'re what\\'s wrong with the world. This isn\\'t just about beating him. It\\'s about whether he\\'s right. BANNER: Natasha! Natasha! Bruce? You all right? Yeah. The team is in the city. It\\'s about to light up. I don\\'t suppose you found a key lying around somewhere. Yeah. I did. (WEAPON POWERING UP) So what\\'s our play? I\\'m here to get you to safety. - Job\\'s not finished. - We could help with the evacuation, but I can\\'t be in a fight near civilians. And you\\'ve done plenty. Our fight is over. So, we just disappear? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (CAR HORNS HONKING) - Come on. FRIDAY: Your man\\'s in the church, boss. I think he\\'s waiting for you. ULTRON: Come to confess your sins? I don\\'t know. How much time you got? ULTRON: More than you. Uh... Have you been juicing? Little vibranium cocktail? You\\'re looking... I don\\'t wanna say \"puffy.\" You\\'re stalling to protect the people. Well, that is the mission. Did you forget? I\\'ve moved beyond your mission. I\\'m free. What? You think you were the only one stalling? FRIDAY: There\\'s the rest of the vibranium. Function, still unclear. ULTRON: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. (MAN GASPS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Go! WANDA: Get off the bridge! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Run! (GROANS) VISION: Ultron. My Vision. They really did take everything from me. You set the terms. You can change them. All right. (GASPING) (VISION GRUNTING) (CRACKS NECK) Friday, the Vision? FRIDAY: Boss, it\\'s working. He\\'s burning Ultron out of the net. He won\\'t escape through there. (GROANING) ULTRON: You shut me out. You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. (POWERING UP) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (RUMBLING) (SCREAMING) (SHOUTING) (GROANING) Friday. FRIDAY: Sokovia is going for a ride. (YELPING) ULTRON: Do you see the beauty of it? The inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor. My swift and terrible sword. And the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. We gotta move. You\\'re not gonna turn green? I\\'ve got a compelling reason not to lose my cool. I adore you. But I need the other guy. (GROWLING) (GRUNTS) Let\\'s finish the job. (ROMANOFF SCREAMING) (GROANS) (PANTING) I really hope this makes us even. (GRUNTS) - Now go be a hero. - (ROARING) FRIDAY: The vibranium core\\'s got a magnetic field. That\\'s what\\'s keeping the rock together. If it drops? Right now, the impact will kill thousands. Once it gets high enough? Global extinction. That building\\'s not clear. The 10th floor. (ALL WHIMPERING) Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge. (GRUNTS) Cap, you got incoming. Incoming already came in. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job, tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt them back. You get killed, walk it off. (PANTING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - (ROARING) - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Go, go, go! WANDA: How could I let this happen? - Hey, hey, you okay? - This is all our fault. Hey, look at me. It\\'s your fault, it\\'s everyone\\'s fault. Who cares? Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know. Because the city is flying. Okay. Look, the city is flying, we\\'re fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. (BARTON GRUNTING) But I\\'m going back out there because it\\'s my job. Okay? And I can\\'t do my job and babysit. It doesn\\'t matter what you did or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you\\'re good. I\\'ll send your brother to come find you. But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. All right. Good chat. Yeah, the city is flying. (EXHALES) - (BOTH YELPING) - (WHIMPERING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (MEN SCREAMING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) ROGERS: I got you! Just look at me! (GRUNTING) ULTRON: You can\\'t save them all. You\\'ll never... \"Never\" what? You didn\\'t finish! What, were you napping? (RETCHING) (GRUNTING) Thor. You\\'re bothering me. Ow! (BARTON GROANING) (SIGHS) All right, we\\'re all clear here. ROGERS: We are not clear! We are very not clear! (GRUNTING) All right, coming to you. - PIETRO: Keep up, old man! - (GASPS) Nobody would know. Nobody. \"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.\" \"Yeah, he\\'ll be missed, that quick little bastard.\" \"I miss him already.\" Hold your fire! Romanoff! Thanks! (BEEPING) FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch them, they\\'ll go full reverse thrust. The city\\'s not coming down slow. Spire is vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it... It will crack. That\\'s not enough. The impact would still be devastating. STARK: Maybe if we can cap the other end. Keep the atomic action doubling back. FRIDAY: That could vaporise the city. And everyone on it. (PANTING) ROGERS: The next wave is gonna hit any minute. - What do you got, Stark? - STARK: Huh? Nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That\\'ll keep it from impacting the surface, if you guys can get clear. I asked for a solution, not an escape plan. STARK: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We\\'re gonna have to make a choice. ROMANOFF: Cap, these people are going nowhere. - If Stark finds a way to blow this rock... - Not till everyone\\'s safe. Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There\\'s no math there. I\\'m not leaving this rock with one civilian on it. I didn\\'t say we should leave. There\\'s worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this? FURY ON RADIO: Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It\\'s about to get better. (PANTING) FURY: Nice, right? Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She\\'s dusty, but she\\'ll do. Fury, you son of a bitch. Ooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth? Altitude is 18,000 and climbing. Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two... Take them out. This is S.H.I.E.L.D.? This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to be. (CHUCKLES) This is not so bad. Let\\'s load them up. Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank. Show \\'em what we got. You\\'re up. Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story. STARK: Yup. If you live to tell it. RHODES: (SCOFFS) You think I can\\'t hold my own? We get through this, I\\'ll hold your own. RHODES: You had to make it weird. (PEOPLE CLAMOURING) I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group. Here we go. Here we go. Let\\'s move. MALE OFFICER: Let\\'s go, everyone! Number six boat is topped and locked... (STAMMERS) Or stocked... Topped... It\\'s full of people. (ALARM BLARING) Incoming! Oh, God! (GRUNTING) ULTRON: You think you\\'re saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it\\'s still billions dead. Even you can\\'t stop that. I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast... I am running out of things to say! Are you ready? VISION: It\\'s terribly well-balanced. Well, if there\\'s too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so... STARK: I got it. Create a heat seal. I could... I could supercharge the spire from below. FRIDAY: Running numbers. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) FRIDAY: A heat seal could work with enough power. - STARK: Thor, I got a plan. - THOR: We\\'re out of time. They\\'re coming for the core. Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier. - On it. - Avengers, time to work for a living. - Are you good? - Yeah. Romanoff. You and Banner better not be playing \"hide the zucchini.\" ROMANOFF: Relax, shellhead. Not all of us can fly. (PANTING) - What\\'s the drill? - This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. Is that the best you can do? You had to ask. This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you against all of me. How can you possibly hope to stop me? Well, like the old man said... Together. (ROARING) (STRAINING) (SPITS) (GROANING) You know, with the benefit of hindsight... (GROWLS) They\\'ll try to leave the city. We can\\'t let them, not even one. Rhodey. RHODES: I\\'m on it. Oh, no. I didn\\'t say you could leave. War Machine coming at you! Right... Okay, what? We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats. I\\'ll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you. - What about the core? - I\\'ll protect it. It\\'s my job. Nat. This way. (PANTING) Get the people on the boats. I\\'m not going to leave you here. I can handle this. Come back for me when everyone else is off. - Not before. - (GRUNTS IN ANNOYANCE) You understand? You know, I\\'m 12 minutes older than you. (CHUCKLES) Go. FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below... Reroute everything. We get one shot at this. BARTON: I know what I need to do. The dining room. If I knock out that east wall, it\\'d make a nice workspace for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling. She can\\'t hear the kids running around. What do you think? You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway. BARTON: No one eats in a dining room. (PEOPLE CLAMOURING) (ROARING) We don\\'t have a lot of time. So get your ass on a boat. (PANTING) Hey, big guy. Sun\\'s getting real low. ROGERS: You\\'re safe now. You\\'re gonna be okay. Buckle up. Secure your gear, find a seat. ZRINKA: Costel! We were in the market. Costel! STARK: Thor, I\\'m gonna need you back in the church. - Is this the last of them? - Yeah. - Everyone else is on the carrier. - STARK: You know, this works, we maybe don\\'t walk away. Maybe not. (GRUNTING) (ROMANOFF GROANS) (ROARING) (SINGING) I got no strings, so I have fun. I\\'m not tied up to anyone. Come on. Time to go. (GRUNTS) You didn\\'t see that coming? (INAUDIBLE) (PANTING) (GROWLING) ULTRON: Oh, for God\\'s sake. - Zrinka! - Costel! Baby! (SOBBING) (GROANING) No, no, I\\'m fine. Fine. It\\'s been a long day. Wanda. If you stay here, you\\'ll die. I just did. Do you know how it felt? (GROANING) It felt like that. (POWERING DOWN) (GRUNTS) STARK: Thor, on my mark. Now! (YELLING) ROMANOFF: Hey, big guy. We did it. The job is finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can\\'t track you in stealth mode. So help me out. I need you... You\\'re afraid. Of you? Of death. You\\'re the last one. You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a saviour and settled for a slave. I suppose we are both disappointments. (ULTRON LAUGHING) I suppose we are. Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites and try to control what won\\'t be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that. They\\'re doomed. Yes. But a thing isn\\'t beautiful because it lasts. It\\'s a privilege to be among them. You\\'re unbearably naive. Well... I was born yesterday. (GASPS) (BREATH ES DEEPLY) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - LAURA: Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat! - (GURGLING) Fat. FURY: One of our tech boys flagged this. Splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark\\'s stealth tech, we still can\\'t track the damn thing. Right. Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He\\'ll send a postcard. \"Wish you were here.\" You sent me to recruit him way back when. Did you know then what was gonna happen? You never know. You hope for the best, then make do with what you get. I got a great team. Nothing lasts forever. Trouble, Ms. Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around. ROGERS: The rules have changed. STARK: We\\'re dealing with something new. Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence. - A machine. - So, it doesn\\'t count? No, it\\'s not like a person lifting the hammer. Right, different rules for us. - Nice guy. Artificial. - ROGERS: Thank you. He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It\\'s safe with the Vision. And these days, safe is in short supply. But if you put the hammer in an elevator... - It would still go up. - Elevator\\'s not worthy. I\\'m gonna miss these little talks of ours. Not if you don\\'t leave. I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. It\\'s not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. And once all these pieces are in position... Triple Yahtzee. You think you can find out what\\'s coming? I do. Besides this one, there\\'s nothing that can\\'t be explained. That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I\\'m gonna miss him, though. And you\\'re gonna miss me. There\\'s gonna be a lot of manful tears. - (CAR LOCK BEEPS) - (ENGINE STARTS) I will miss you, Tony. Yeah? Well, it\\'s time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton\\'s book. Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up. The simple life. - You\\'ll get there one day. - I don\\'t know. Family, stability... The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago. I think someone else came out. You all right? (SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) I\\'m home. You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work? I mean, it\\'s a pretty interesting wall. I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other\\'s eyes. How do we look? Well, we\\'re not the \\'27 Yankees. We got some hitters. They\\'re good. They\\'re not a team. Let\\'s beat them into shape. Avengers... THANOS: Fine. I\\'ll do it myself. Stark! He doesn\\'t seem happy. Hello, Hank. You\\'re supposed to be in Moscow. I took a detour... Through your defense lab. Tell me that isn\\'t what I think it is. That depends if you think it\\'s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve. You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you\\'re a soldier... I\\'m a scientist. Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed. Help us put it to good use. I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research? If only you\\'d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym. Ah... Easy, Hank. You mention my wife again and I\\'ll show you ferocity. Don\\'t look at me. You said it. I formally tender my resignation. We don\\'t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please. Don\\'t let your past determine the future. As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. We shouldn\\'t let him leave the building. You\\'ve already lied to him. Now you want to go to war with him? Yes. Our scientists haven\\'t come close to replicating his work. He just kicked your ass, full-size. You really want to find out what it\\'s like when you can\\'t see him coming? I\\'ve known Hank Pym for a long time. He\\'s no security risk. Unless we make him one. You like that? You like that? Come get you some now. You didn\\'t even move. Nah. What if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here. You see this right here? I\\'m gonna miss you, Scott. I\\'m gonna miss you, too, Peachy. Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. All right, break it up. Break it up! Break it up! Scotty! What\\'s up, man! Damn! Hey. Ha-ha! Hey, man. Hey, what\\'s up with your eye? Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy. It\\'s a going-away present. Oh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. You know what? I\\'m still the only one who knocked him out. Well, I definitely didn\\'t. Thanks for picking me up, brother. Bro, you think I\\'m gonna miss my celly getting out? Hey, how\\'s your girl, man? Oh, she left me. - Oh. - Yeah, my ma died, too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van! - It\\'s nice. - Yeah, right? Thanks for the hook-up, too. I needed a place to stay. You wait till you see this couch. You\\'re gonna be really happy. You\\'re gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch. - I hope so. - Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people. Some really skilled people. - Not interested. - Yeah, right. No, I\\'m serious, man. I\\'m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of. You know that jobs don\\'t come easy for ex-cons, right? Look, man, I got a master\\'s in electrical engineering, all right? I\\'m gonna be fine. Welcome to Baskin-Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast? Uh, no, thanks. Um, I will have... I\\'ll have a burger, please. Oh, we don\\'t... We don\\'t make that. Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard... Do you have mustard dip? It\\'s ice cream. Baskin-Robbins. I\\'ll just do, like, whatever\\'s hot and fresh. Dude. Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto. Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh, take care of this idiot? Thanks. - Hey, Dale. - Come on in. Pull up some chair. Three years at San Quentin, huh? You found out. Baskin-Robbins always finds out. Look, I\\'m sorry, all right? But I... No one would hire me. Breaking and entering. Grand larceny. Look, I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t do it anymore. I just... Respect. I couldn\\'t be happier about it. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. You really stuck it to those billionaire SOBs. The more I read about what you did and stuff... I\\'m like, \"Wow, I know this guy? \"I\\'m in charge of this guy?\" Well, I\\'m very happy in this job, and I really just appreciate the opportunity to... Well, you\\'re fired, of course. I can\\'t really keep you on. Wait, what? Fired? Yeah. Dale, look, it wasn\\'t a violent crime. I mean, I\\'m a good worker. No, it wasn\\'t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I\\'ll tell you what, though. This will be totally off the books, off the records, but if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I\\'ll just pretend I didn\\'t see it. Hey, Scotty. What\\'s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work. I was. I got fired. Damn. They find out who you are? Yeah. Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro. Baskin-Robbins don\\'t play. - You want some waffles? - Yeah, I\\'ll take a waffle. Oh. That\\'s Kurt. He was Folsom for five years. He\\'s a wizard on that laptop. - Nice meet you. - Yeah. Nice to meet you, too. Who are you? Dave. Nice work on the Vista job. Vista job, yes. No, no. I have heard of this robbery. Well, technically, I didn\\'t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence. I burgled them. I\\'m a cat burglar. You mean you\\'re a pussy. Yeah. They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from. Posts all the bank records online. And he drove the dude\\'s Bentley into his swimming pool. What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life story to these guys? What do you want? Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago - about this little perfect job. - No way. No, no, no. Wait! This guy... This guy fits your M.O. No! I\\'m finished, man. I\\'m not going back to jail. It\\'s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute. It\\'s a perfect Scott Lang mark! I don\\'t care. I\\'m out. Dr. Pym? Yes. I\\'m still alive. ID? Perhaps that will suffice. Very sorry, sir. Please come in. Is that Hank Pym? Good morning, Hank. Hope. Would it kill you to call me Dad? Dr. Cross will be so pleased that you could find the time to join us today. More like \"thrilled.\" I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What\\'s the occasion? Oh, you\\'ll see. Won\\'t he, Hope? We\\'re ready for you inside. Ouch. I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don\\'t worry, she\\'s in good hands. You\\'re in for a treat. Long time, no see, Dr. Pym. How\\'s retirement? How\\'s your face? After you. Now, before we start, I\\'d like to introduce a very special guest. This company\\'s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms, while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank\\'s research, I couldn\\'t tell you. But just imagine, a soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. An Ant-Man. That\\'s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish! Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, \"Was the Ant-Man real?\" Just a tall tale. Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it\\'s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it. The Yellowjacket! Oh, no. The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It\\'s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel, The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the geopolitical landscape completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions. And, one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket. So, it\\'s a suit? Don\\'t be crude, Frank. It\\'s not a suit, it\\'s a vessel. What\\'s the matter? You\\'re not impressed? No, I\\'m impressed. I\\'m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech. We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope? Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you. You seem a bit shocked. Darren, there\\'s a reason that I buried these secrets. So you finally admit it! We could have done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That\\'s why you\\'re the past and I\\'m the future. Don\\'t do this. Dr. Cross? You sell to me first, 20% over your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks. Deal. We have to make our move, Hank. How close is he? He still can\\'t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all. No. I have Cross\\' complete trust. - It\\'s too dangerous. - We don\\'t have a choice. Well, that\\'s not entirely true. I think I found a guy. Who? Daddy! Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I\\'m so sorry I\\'m late. I didn\\'t know what time your party started. It was on the invitation. He didn\\'t get an invitation. But he came anyway! Well, I\\'m not gonna miss my little girl\\'s birthday party. I\\'m gonna go tell Mommy you\\'re here. Oh, you don\\'t... What are you doing here, Lang? You haven\\'t paid a dime of child support. You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you. It\\'s good to see you too, Paxton. Mommy\\'s so happy you\\'re here, she choked on her drink. Hey, look what I have for you. Can I open it now? Of course, sweetheart. It\\'s your birthday. You\\'re my bestest friend. What is that thing? He\\'s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends? Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead. You\\'re my bestest friend. Look, the child support is coming, all right? It\\'s just hard finding a job when you have a record. I\\'m sure you\\'ll figure it out. But for now, I want you out of my house. - No way! It\\'s my daughter\\'s birthday. - It\\'s my house! - So what? It\\'s my kid! - Scott! You can\\'t just show up here. You know that. Come on. It\\'s a birthday party. Yeah, I know, but you can\\'t just show up. She\\'s my daughter. You don\\'t know the first thing about being a father. Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life. Your fiancé is an asshat. He\\'s not an asshat. - Hey, watch your language. Okay? - What language? I said \"hat.\" Stop it. Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on! You could marry anyone you want, and you have to get engaged to a cop? At least he\\'s not a crook. I\\'m trying, okay? I\\'ve changed. I\\'m straight. I had a job and... I wanna provide. I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her. So much. I\\'ve missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life. What do I do? Get an apartment, get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You\\'re her hero, Scott. Just be the person that she already thinks you are. I\\'m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank. Yeah. Well, uh... Unfortunately, we can\\'t just do whatever we want. It\\'d be nice though, right? But there are laws. What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man. And I\\'ve transcended the laws of nature. Darren, I don\\'t think you understand... Hmm. We still haven\\'t worked out all the bugs. Goodbye, Frank. Thank you. You know, I\\'ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately. And today, during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me, and I think it might apply to you, too. How\\'s that? Gratitude can be forgiveness. I\\'ve spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could have worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn\\'t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It\\'s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn\\'t he? But we shouldn\\'t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings. You\\'re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way. Ooh. Stop cheating. Hey, what\\'s up, hotshot? Maybe he didn\\'t hear you. How was the party? - Tell me about that tip. - What? I wanna know about that tip. Oh, baby, it\\'s on! It\\'s so on, right now. Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from. It\\'s gotta be airtight. Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto. Which was mainly reds, and you know I don\\'t like reds, man. But there was a rosé that saved the day. It was delightful. And then he tells me about this girl, Emily, that we used to kick it with. It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched. It\\'s the wrong details. It has nothing to do with the story. Go. So, uh, he tells me that she\\'s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she\\'s dating this dude, Carlos, who\\'s a shot caller from across the bay. And she tells him about the dude that she\\'s cleaning for. Right? That he\\'s like this big-shot CEO That is all retired now, but he\\'s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team, and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says, \"Yo, man. \"This guy\\'s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chilling.\" Of course Ernesto comes to me because he knows I got mad thieving skills. Of course, I ask him... \"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?\" And he says, \"Nah, dawg. \"All she said is that it\\'s super-legit \"and whatever\\'s in it, it\\'s gotta be good.\" What? Old man have safe. And he\\'s gone for a week. All right. There\\'s an old man, he\\'s got a safe, and he\\'s gone for a week. Let\\'s just work with that. You know what I\\'m saying? Landline\\'s cut, cell signal\\'s jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight. Comm check. - Check. - Check. Hey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right? Don\\'t worry. It\\'s not gonna happen. I love it when he gets cocky. Damn! Alarm is dead. Nice. All right, I\\'m moving through the house. There\\'s a fingerprint lock on the door. It\\'s got what? Ernesto didn\\'t tell me nothing about that. Aw, man, are we screwed? Not necessarily. I\\'m in. No alarms have been triggered. He\\'s in like the Flynn. Oh, man. What is it? Well, they weren\\'t kidding. This safe is serious. How serious are we talking, Scotty? It\\'s a Carbondale. It\\'s from 1910. Made from the same steel as the Titanic. Wow. Can you crack it? Well, here\\'s the thing. It doesn\\'t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did? Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio. Killed everybody. Did not kill the Old lady. She still throw the jewel into the oceans. What are you doing? I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands. Metal doesn\\'t. - What are you doing now? - Waiting. Waiting. Nice. What is it? Cash? Jewels? - There\\'s nothing here. - What did you say? - It\\'s a suit. - What? It\\'s an old motorcycle suit. There\\'s no cash, no jewelry, nothing? No. It\\'s a bust. I\\'m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed to score. I thought we were using mice. What\\'s the difference? Commence Experiment 34-C. Organic atomic reduction. Darren, maybe we should think... Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can\\'t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough. Experiment 34-C results, negative. Sanitize the work station. Bring in subject 35-C. Why would you lock this up? This is so weird. Scotty, what\\'s up, man? I wonder... What is this? The world sure seems different from down here, doesn\\'t it, Scott? What? Who said that? Luis, down here! It\\'s a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case, water. Guess you\\'re tougher than you thought. Oh, I don\\'t want to see this! Luis! Son of a... What the hell? Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit. I\\'ll be in touch. No! No! No, thank you! Get down on the ground! You are under arrest! No, I didn\\'t steal anything! I was returning something I stole. Oh... Don\\'t move. You know, you almost had us convinced that you were gonna change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It\\'s gonna break their hearts. - You got a visitor. - Who? Your lawyer. My lawyer? I told you I\\'d be in touch, Scott. I\\'m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell. Oh, man. Sit down. Sir, I\\'m sorry I stole the suit. I don\\'t even wanna know why you have it. Maggie was right about you. How do you know about... No wonder she\\'s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison, or go back to your cell and await further instructions. I don\\'t understand. No, I don\\'t expect you to. But you don\\'t have many options right now, and quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place? What? Second chances don\\'t come around all that much. So, next time you think you might see one, I suggest you take a real close look at it. You\\'re my bestest friend! Are you sure you don\\'t want a different toy? No, I love this one. Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you. - Mommy? - Hmm? Is Daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he\\'s bad. No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know? Smart choice. You actually listened, for once. Under the door. Okay, where to now? - Hang tight. - Oh, God. What, what? Where the hell did he go? I have no idea. He just vanished. Set up a five-block perimeter. Now! Get back! Get back! Scott, these are my associates. Is that a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure. Why not? Where\\'s the car? No car. We\\'ve got wings. Incoming! Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax. - How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott! Why am I on a police car? Shouldn\\'t I not be on a police car? So they can give you a lift past their five-block perimeter. All right. - Now, what\\'s the next move? - Hang on tight. Oh, this is easy! I\\'m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It\\'s like a horse. You\\'re throwing 247 off balance. Wait, his name is 247? He doesn\\'t have a name, he has a number, Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are? Whoa! Maybe it\\'s... Maybe it\\'s 248. No, no! Vertigo, vertigo! - No, I think it\\'s 247. - Wait. Hang on tight! I think I\\'m getting the hang of this. I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you. What? - Can I make one little request? - No. Stop, 247! Time out, time out. Time out. All right, hold on. Just wait! Whoa! What happens if I throw up in this helmet? It\\'s my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up. Let\\'s set her down, all right? I\\'m getting light-headed. Hang on, Scott. I\\'m getting a little light... I need a snooze button. Hit me in 5 minutes. Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there, watching me sleep, this whole time? Yes. Why? Because the last time you were here, you stole something. Oh. Oh. Hey, look... Whoa! Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants, ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They\\'re here to keep an eye on you when I can\\'t. Dr. Pym\\'s waiting for you downstairs. Who? Hey! Um... Whose pajamas are these? How am I supposed to do this? All right, just one step at a time. Ugh! You don\\'t bite me, I don\\'t step on you. Deal? I could take down the servers and Cross wouldn\\'t even know it. We don\\'t need this guy. I assume that you\\'ve already met my daughter, Hope. I did. She\\'s great. She doesn\\'t think that we need you. We don\\'t. We can do this ourselves. I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested. Okay, we can try this and when he fails, I\\'ll do it myself. She\\'s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you\\'re sitting opposite me, I take it that you\\'re interested in. What job? Would you like some tea? Uh... Sure. I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever. Were you watching me? Scott, I\\'ve been watching you for a while. Ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh! Excuse me. \"Burgled\" Vista Corp. Vista\\'s security system was one of the most advanced in the business. It was supposed to be unbeatable. But you beat it. Would you like some sugar? Yeah, thanks. You know what? I\\'m okay. How do you make them do that? Ants can lift objects 50 times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other. Right. But how do you make them do that? I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything. And still know absolutely nothing. I\\'m late to meet Cross. Uh... Dr. Pym? You don\\'t need to raise your hand, Scott. Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you, who is she, what the hell\\'s going on, and can I go back to jail now? Come with me. 40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance. Huh? I learned how to change the distance between atoms. That\\'s what powers the suit. That\\'s why it works. Wow. - Whoa! - But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that\\'s when I switched gears and I started my own company. Pym Tech. Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross. Darren Cross. He\\'s a big deal. But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him. The son I never had, perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close, he began to suspect that I wasn\\'t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn\\'t help him. So he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company. How could he do that? The board\\'s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. If one isn\\'t protected by a specialized helmet, it can affect the brain\\'s chemistry. I don\\'t think Darren realizes this, and, you know, he\\'s not the most stable guy to begin with. So, what do you want from me? Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you? I do. If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now, are you ready to redeem yourself? Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do? I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight? Uh, yeah. I\\'ll pick something up. Text me. Okay. Good news? Uh... I don\\'t know. It\\'s news. Are you trying to find my daddy? Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe. Hope you don\\'t catch him. This isn\\'t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry. That\\'s Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D. Presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech. And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world. I think our first move should be calling the Avengers. I spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I\\'m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides, they\\'re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky. Okay, then why don\\'t you just send the ants? Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that could infiltrate a place that\\'s designed to prevent infiltration. Hank, I\\'m a thief, all right? I mean, I\\'m a good thief, but this is insane. He\\'s right, Hank. And you know it. You\\'ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, and now we have days. I\\'m wearing the suit. Absolutely not! I know the facility inside and out. I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here. We need you close to Cross. Otherwise, this mission cannot work. - We don\\'t have time to screw around! - Hope, please listen to me... He is a criminal! I\\'m your daughter. No! She\\'s right, Hank. I\\'m not your guy. Why don\\'t you wear the suit? You think I don\\'t want to? I can\\'t. I spent years wearing it, and it took a toll on me. You\\'re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and there\\'s just disappointment. It\\'s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter\\'s eyes. To become the hero that she already thinks you are. It\\'s not about saving our world. It\\'s about saving theirs. Damn. That was a good speech. Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man. In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power. The man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime. So your size always suits your needs. Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. Ow! Ahhh! Ow! Useless. When you\\'re small, energy\\'s compressed, so you have the force of a 200-pound man behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide. You\\'re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone. Too soft, it\\'s a love tap. In other words, you have to know how to punch. I was in prison for three years. I know how to punch. Show me. - Terrible. - You wanna show me how to punch? Show me... That\\'s how you punch. - She\\'s been looking forward to this. - No kidding. Hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time. Oh, by \"difficult time,\" he means when my mother died. We lost her in a plane crash. It\\'s bad enough you won\\'t tell me how she died. Could you please stop telling me that lie? We\\'re working, here. All right, princess. Let\\'s get back to work. Were you going for the hand? You know, I think this regulator is holding me back. Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised, you would go subatomic. What does that mean? It means that you would enter a quantum realm. What does that mean? It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know and love, gone forever. Cool. Yeah, if it ain\\'t broke... You\\'ve learned about the suit, but you\\'ve yet to learn about your greatest allies, the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job. Paratrechina longicornis. Commonly known as crazy ants. They\\'re lightning fast and can conduct electricity, which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. You\\'re not so crazy. Hey! You\\'re cute. That was a lot scarier a second ago. It looks like the Futures Lab has its own isolated power supply. There\\'s a security guard posted around the clock. We\\'ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems. Okay, who\\'s next? Paraponera clavata. I know. Bullet ants, right? Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index? Hey, guys. Remember me from the bedroom? The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed, And the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter. Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach? The tube is protected by a laser grid, and we can only power that down for 15 seconds. You\\'re gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on. Camponotus pennsylvanicus. Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport. Wait a minute, I know this guy. I\\'m gonna call him \"Ant-thony.\" That\\'s good. That\\'s very good. Because this time, you\\'re really gonna have to learn how to control him. Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup. Aw! You okay? Did I hurt... Hank wants you outside for target practice. The suit has no weapons, so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges. Solenopsis mandibularis. Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places. You can do it, Scott. Come on. They\\'re not listening to me. You have to commit. You have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies. Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope. We don\\'t have time for coddling. Our focus should be on helping Scott! Really? Is that where our focus should be? Hope! I don\\'t know why I came to you in the first place. We can\\'t do this without her. Oh, God. You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really, there\\'s some weird folks in this neighborhood. Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he\\'s asking you to risk? You have a daughter. I\\'m doing this for her. You know, when my mother died, I didn\\'t see him for two weeks. He was in grief. Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back. Not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that\\'s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance of making peace. But, even now, he still wants to shut me out. He doesn\\'t wanna shut you out. He trusts you. Then why are you here? It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I\\'m expendable. That\\'s why I\\'m here. You must have realized that by now. I mean, it\\'s why I\\'m in the suit and you\\'re not. He would rather lose this fight than lose you. Anyway... You know, I didn\\'t know you had a daughter when I called the cops on you. What\\'s her name? Cassie. It\\'s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise. That\\'s how it works. Think about Cassie. About how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus. Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. That\\'s good! Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there\\'s not a day that goes by that I don\\'t regret having said yes. It was 1987. Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium. I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile. But my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn\\'t hesitate. Janet! No! She turned off her regulator and went subatomic to deactivate the bomb. And she was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next 10 years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm. You were trying to bring her back. But all I learned was we know nothing. It\\'s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn\\'t you tell me that sooner? I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn\\'t mean to lose you, too. I\\'m sorry. This is awesome. It\\'s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you\\'re healing. It\\'s important. I ruined the moment, didn\\'t I? Yes, you did. Yes. I\\'m going to make some tea. Nailed it! That\\'s a good boy, Ant-thony. The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion. It\\'s freezing! You couldn\\'t make a suit with a flannel lining? You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy. It\\'s a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days. We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault. It\\'s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark\\'s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake. You\\'re over the target area. Disengage now, Scott! Squadron A, go! B, go! C, go! All right, Ant-thony, please don\\'t drop me this time. Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this! Stay calm. Guys? We might have a problem. Hank, didn\\'t you say this was some old warehouse? It\\'s not! You son of a bitch! - Scott, get out of there. - Abort! Abort now! No, it\\'s okay. It doesn\\'t look like anyone\\'s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof! He\\'s gonna lose the suit. He\\'s gonna lose his life. All right, I\\'m on the roof of the target building. Somebody\\'s home, Scott. What\\'s going on down there, Sam? It\\'s the Falcon! I had a sensor trip but I\\'m not seeing anything. Wait a second. Abort, Scott! Abort now! It\\'s okay. He can\\'t see me. I can see you. He can see me. Hi. I\\'m Scott. Did he just say, \"Hi, I\\'m Scott\"? - What are you doing here? - First off, I\\'m a big fan. Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you? I\\'m Ant-Man. \"Ant-Man\"? What? You haven\\'t heard of me? No, you wouldn\\'t have heard of me. You wanna tell me what you want? I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology. Just for a few days. I\\'m gonna return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is. I know exactly how that is. Located the breach. - Bringing him in. - Sorry about this! What the hell are you doing? Breach is an adult male, who has some sort of shrinking tech. Sorry! Look, I\\'m sorry about this. Sorry. That\\'s enough! Ant-thony! A little help! I\\'ve lost visual. He\\'s inside my pack! Sorry! You seem like a really great guy. It\\'s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this. That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! You got it. Well done. Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? - He did, didn\\'t he? - Kind of sounded like he did. I was good, wasn\\'t I? Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn\\'t die? Let us not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. Don\\'t mind him. You did good. Darren. How the hell did you get in here? You left the front door open, Hank. It\\'s official. You\\'re old. The plans. He will kill him. Well, to what do I owe this pleasure? I have good news. Really? What\\'s that? Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We\\'re anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone. You\\'re welcome. I know this is odd, but I\\'d like you to be there. This is my moment. I want you to see it. Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I\\'ll be there. What did you see in me? I don\\'t know what you mean. All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see? I saw myself. Then why did you push me away? Because I saw too much of myself. He knows. He\\'s baiting you. We have to call it off. We\\'re all taking risks. What if he saw me here? He didn\\'t. There\\'s no way. How do you know that? Darren, hi. Hope, where are you right now? I\\'m at home. Why? I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him. Don\\'t let him rile you up. He\\'s just a senile old man. We need to start everyone working around the clock. Get the assembly line up and running. And I\\'m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh. Great. Good idea. Thank you, Hope. I\\'m so lucky to have you on my team. He\\'s tripling security. He\\'s lost his mind, and he\\'s onto you. But he is not onto you. He\\'s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside? The water main. You can\\'t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that\\'s how I get in. Somebody would have to reach the building\\'s control center to change the water pressure. Hank and I will be beside Cross. How are we supposed to do that? So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to de-pressurize the water system, somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy. No, no. No, no, no. Not those three Wombats. No way. Thank you for the coffee, ma\\'am. It\\'s not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you. You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right? Two smoothie machines. Are you sure they can handle this? Oh, we can handle it. We\\'re professionals. You\\'ll forgive us if we\\'re not instilled with confidence. Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man. We know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn\\'t we? I let you. Well, one could say that I let you let me. - Look, it\\'s okay. They can handle this. - Yeah, we can handle it. - You got their credentials? - He\\'s in the system. - I\\'m in the system? - You\\'re in the system. The system? Yeah, we\\'re doomed. All right. There\\'s something you guys need to see. When you get to this corner, there\\'s gonna be three offices on your left side. Damn! Whoa! That\\'s so cool, bro! Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right? It\\'s pretty freaky, but it\\'s safe. There\\'s no reason to be scared. Oh, no, no. Daddy don\\'t get scared. - Really? - Yeah. Good. This is the work of gypsies. That\\'s witchcraft. Wow, that\\'s amazing. That\\'s like some David Copperfield shit. That\\'s some kind of wizardry. This is sorcery! How\\'d you do that, bro? Don\\'t freak out. Look at your shoulder. Ahhh! Get off! Get off! Wait, I thought Daddy didn\\'t get scared! I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. They fell right asleep. Hey, look, I wanna thank you for... No, please don\\'t. We\\'re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I\\'m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off. Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk. You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you to almost liking you. You really should write poetry. Get some sleep, Scott. All right, just so we\\'re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? - Dave? - Wheels on the ground. - Kurt? - Eyes in the sky. - Luis? - Oh, man, you know it. You know what? I get to wear a uniform. - That\\'s what\\'s up. - Luis. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m good. I\\'m good. I\\'m just excited. Plus, your girlfriend\\'s really hot. So, you know, that makes me nervous, too. And you are very beautiful, ma\\'am. - Oh, my Lord. - She\\'s not my... You know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover. Like a whistling. You know what I\\'m saying? To like, blend in. No. Don\\'t whistle. No whistling. It\\'s not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling. All clear in Sector One. Step out. All clear. We\\'re set. Wish me luck. Utilities online. Hey! What are you doing? Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I\\'m securing it. I\\'m the boss. - Oh. - Utilities 1.3... Water level is dropping! Coming up on extraction pipe. All right, I see it. All right, come on, I gotta get up there. That\\'s it. That\\'s it, guys! Yes! Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on! All right, let\\'s fly, Ant-thony. The Ant-Man is in the building. Pym\\'s pulling up. Right on time. Got a Crown Vic right outside there. This is problem? Considering the Crown Vic\\'s the most commonly used car for undercover cops, man, yes, this is problem. That\\'s Pym. Oh, no. I\\'m deploying the bullet ants. Papanera Claire de Merna Merna... I don\\'t remember what it\\'s called, but I feel bad for this guy. - What\\'s up, man? - Hey. Ow! Ow! See? That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. That\\'s what I call an unfortunate casualty in a very serious operation. Signal decoy in place. Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott. Looks like Pym\\'s getting arrested. Scott, we have problem. Problem? What\\'s the problem? Dave! Dave, that\\'s not part of plan! Listen to me. If I don\\'t get into this building, people will die. That\\'s awfully dramatic. Are you kidding me? Problem solved. Well... How do I look? There he is. Just in time. Come on. 12-point verification. Little over-the-top, don\\'t you think, Darren? Confirming authorization level. Well, you can never be too safe. Access granted. Gotta hand it to you, Darren. You really did it. And you only know the half of it, Hank. Arriving in second position. All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let\\'s go! Proceeding to command position. I\\'ll be right back, Ant-thony. All right, guys. I\\'m in position. I\\'m gonna signal the ants. No, no, no, no, no! Did you see that? Assume formation. All right, you cute little crazies, let\\'s fry these servers! Let\\'s go get \\'em, buddy! Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased. Heading to the particle chamber. Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates have agreed to your terms. Wonderful. Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here. They\\'re representatives of Hydra. They\\'re not what they were. They\\'re doing some interesting work. And I\\'m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me. And now it\\'s gonna blow up in your face. Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away, but I just figured it\\'d be all pathetic and weak. Well, you figured wrong. I know this van. Anybody home? All right, guys. I\\'m here. I\\'m setting the charges. Great job, guys. I\\'ll take it from here. Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. Guys, how we looking on that laser grid? - Almost. - No, you\\'re not. - I\\'m getting close! - No, you\\'re not. San Francisco P.D.! Out of the van! I know you\\'re in there! - Make it go faster. - Dude, seriously. Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt? So close. - Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze! There was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van. - Get out of the van! - Okay, I\\'m coming. Take it easy! No, I will not move! Go now! - Wait! - What? What do you mean, \"Wait\"? Phew! What? What? Hey, little guy. I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere. Which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? Scott Lang. A martyr who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank! He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how. And then he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name. And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit. The only thing that can rival my creation. Darren, don\\'t do this. If you sell to these men, it\\'s gonna be chaos. I already have. And for twice the price, thanks to you. It\\'s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. I\\'ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I\\'m keeping the particle to myself. They don\\'t run on diesel. If you want the fuel, you\\'ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world? The most powerful man in the world. You proud of me yet? You can stop this, Darren. It\\'s not too late. It\\'s been too late for a long time now. Darren! What are you doing? He wasn\\'t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me. This is not who you are. It\\'s the particles altering your brain chemistry. Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. You\\'re right. I have to be the one to do it. Here we go. Drop your gun. You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there. You\\'re sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down. I wasn\\'t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now! Drop your gun now! You picked the wrong side, Hope. Dad! Hank, no. No, Hank. Hank? Listen, you\\'re gonna be okay. All right? You\\'re gonna be just fine. Take the suit off, or I\\'ll blow your brains out and peel it off. We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech. Request immediate backup! Go, go, go! Get me to the roof. And radio ahead. I want to make sure the helicopter is ready to take off. You two, kill anything that comes out of that vault! Dad, can you move? We need to get him out of here. Go get that suit. Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Thank you, Luis. - Are we the good guys? - Yeah. - We\\'re the good guys, right? - Yeah, we\\'re the good guys. Feels kinda weird, you know. Yeah, but we\\'re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows! Damn it! That guy. Hey! We\\'re getting out of here! The charges are set. We\\'ve gotta find a way out of here. And fast. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not gonna die. And neither are you. It\\'s not a keychain. It\\'s total chaos in here! Multiple shots fired! And there\\'s a tank. A little help! I got it. We need a doctor! We\\'ve got him. Thank you. Let\\'s go! Ant-thony! Go! You\\'re gonna regret that. Wait a minute! Get out of that van! - What? - Get out of that van! It\\'s too loud, there\\'s a tank. I can\\'t hear you! Hey! Hey! Are you crazy? Put the gun down! The windows! Did you think you could stop the future with a heist? It was never just a heist! Put the gun down! Okay, I got him, I got him. There he is! Go, go, go! We gotta set her down somewhere. I\\'m gonna disintegrate you! Playing Disintegration by the Cure. Call 911! It\\'s okay. Freeze! Put your hands up! Get them up! Scott? Paxton, you have to listen to me! Paxton, turn around! Take me back! I am taking you back. To prison. There\\'s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper. There... You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand. All units, we have a 2-36 in progress at 840 Winter Street. - Cassie! - That\\'s my house. Don\\'t be scared. Paxton, let me help! - Don\\'t move. - Let me help! - Maggie! What\\'s going on? - He\\'s got Cassie! - Who\\'s got Cassie, honey? - That thing. - Thing? - I don\\'t know! I don\\'t know! Are you a monster? Do I look like a monster? I want my daddy! I want your daddy, too. There you are. Daddy, is that you? Hi, peanut. Why don\\'t you pick on someone your own size? Now, where did you go, little guy? There you are. Not just me! Damn it! Go! Go! Scotty needs us, you know what I\\'m saying? Ain\\'t nothing gonna stop us. Back it up. - Back it up, slow. - Yeah. - Back it up. - Yeah. - Back it up. - Okay. - We just back it up, okay? - That\\'s it. - Back it up. - That\\'s right. - Backin\\' up? - Yep, just backin\\' up. No, no. Just back it up. You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. You know, it\\'d be much easier to hit you if you were bigger. Yeah, I agree. Cassie! I\\'m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. Cassie! I\\'m coming! That\\'s a messed-up looking dog. I\\'m gonna destroy everything you love. Freeze! S.F.P.D. I can\\'t break through. It\\'s titanium, you idiot! - Get her out of here. - Come on. Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help Daddy pay for his mistakes. - You stay behind me, okay? - Okay. Stay behind me. I\\'m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. Get away from us! Daddy, help! I love you, Cassie. Daddy, where are you? You could go subatomic. You could go subatomic. Oh, no. You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space... All concepts of time and space become irrelevant. ...all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. Come back, Daddy! ...as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know and love, gone forever. Daddy, where are you? Where are you? Where are you? - Daddy! - Cassie. Come back, Daddy! Do not screw with the regulator! Daddy! I love you so much. I love you, too. So much. You know, there\\'s a big hole in the roof. Sorry. - Is she all right? - Yeah, she\\'s fine. Mommy! She\\'s fine, she\\'s fine. Scott, please. You don\\'t remember anything? Hank. I don\\'t. There must be something else. Well, I suppose the human mind just can\\'t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in, and you got out. It\\'s amazing. Scott, I\\'ll walk you out. Get some rest. Is it possible? When did this happen? Nothing\\'s happening. Whoa. Hold on. Something\\'s kind of happening. Well, if that\\'s the case, shoot me again. Yeah. I don\\'t know what you were doing, grabbing and kissing me like that. I\\'m a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I\\'ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. - Scott. - Yeah? - You\\'re full of shit. - Oh, yeah. Scott, I met with my captain today. He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras. Some circuits got fried. But I told him that you were processed correctly. Really? Well, yeah. Can\\'t be sending Cassie\\'s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right? Thank you, Paxton. I\\'m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie. Well, that\\'s my pleasure. But, no. This one, I did for you. - This is awkward. - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that? - Oh, I know. - What? - I did my first cartwheel today. - What? Yeah. She has been practicing all week. But today was the magic day. I recorded it on my phone. Here. No, that can\\'t be Cassie. That\\'s not you. - Yeah, it is. - Yeah, it is. This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that\\'s you. Yeah, that\\'s her. Good boy. Sweetie, that\\'s pretty amazing, peanut. Sorry. It\\'s work. Yeah. All right. Here\\'s the deal. Just give me the facts. Just the facts. Only the facts. Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple. No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay. So, I\\'m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit. But you know me, I\\'m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God! - Luis. - Okay, sorry. Sorry. You know, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, Ignacio tells me, \"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine. \"Like crazy-stupid fine.\" And he goes up to the bartender and goes, \"Look at the girl I\\'m with. You know what I\\'m sayin\\'? \"She\\'s crazy-stupid fine, right?\" The bartender\\'s all like, \"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine.\" So this writer chick tells Ignacio, \"Yo, I\\'m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, \"and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains, \"you know what I\\'m saying?\" Ignacio\\'s like, \"For real?\" And she\\'s like, \"Yeah, you know what, I can\\'t tell you who my contact is, \"because he works with the Avengers.\" Oh, no. Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man. Like, he comes up to her and says, \"Yo, I\\'m looking for this dude who\\'s new on the scene, \"who\\'s flashing his fresh tack, \"who\\'s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?\" And she\\'s like, \"Well, we got everything nowadays. We got a guy who jumps. \"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. \"You gotta be more specific.\" And he\\'s like, \"I\\'m looking for a guy that shrinks.\" And I\\'m, like, \"Damn!\" I got all nervous \\'cause I\\'d keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio, \"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick \"to tell you to tell me, because I\\'m tight with Ant-Man, \"that he\\'s looking for him?\" And? What\\'d he say? He said, \"Yes.\" There\\'s something I want to show you. I realized you can\\'t destroy power. All you can do is make sure that it\\'s in the right hands. This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it. But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you. Maybe it\\'s time we finished it. It\\'s about damn time. Hey, Cap! This would have been a lot easier a week ago. - If we call Tony... - He won\\'t believe us. Even if he did... Who knows if the Accords will let him help. We\\'re on our own. Maybe not. I know a guy. Do you know what time it is? Can\\'t sleep. There are tabs for that. Yeah, but then I\\'d be sleeping. Dreams again? Wanna fight? I slipped. Right, you slipped as a result of me punching you in the face. I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. The two events were not related. Tell me about this dream. - Anything new? - No. You have to let go of the past. I don\\'t remember my past. It\\'s causing you doubt, and doubt makes you vulnerable. Control it. Lose control again, and you\\'ll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence. There\\'s nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion. Humor is a distraction. And anger? Anger only serves the enemy. One hundred twenty days since the last Skrull attack. Has anyone ever seen what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like? No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form. You know that. Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us. So it\\'s sacred. It\\'s personal. No Kree divulges it, ever. Who do you see? - Your brother? - No. - Father? - No. - Your old commander? - Vers. It\\'s me you see, isn\\'t it? I see what you\\'re trying to do. - Is it working? - Yes. But you won\\'t succeed in changing the subject. What is the point of giving me these... if you don\\'t want me to use them? I want you to use them. The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility... of showing you how to use them. I know how. Yeah, if that were true, you\\'d be able to knock me down without them. Control your impulses. Stop using this, start using this. I want you to be the best version of yourself. Vers. Intelligence. Your commander insists that you\\'re fit to serve. I am. You struggle with your emotions... with your past, which fuels them. You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion... that has threatened our civilization for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate... then take over our planets. Horrors that you remember... and so much that you do not. It\\'s all blank. My life. You\\'re supposed to take the form of who I most admire... but I don\\'t even remember who this person was to me. Perhaps this is a mercy sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must... put your people\\'s needs before your own. We\\'ve given you a great gift. The chance to fight for the good of all Kree. I want to serve. Then master yourself. What was given can be taken away. I won\\'t let you down. We\\'ll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well, and with honor. This can\\'t be good. Must be another Skrull attack. Whatever it is, it\\'s big. Has a Skrull ever simmed you? Once. - It was deeply disturbing. - Why? Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy... and the face staring back was my own. Maybe if you were more attractive, then it would be less disturbing. You think you\\'re funny, but I\\'m not laughing. You never laugh. I laugh on the inside. I\\'m not doing that now. It\\'s funny \\'cause, objectively speaking, you\\'re quite handsome. Well, thank you. Listen up, team. Knock it off. All right. Prepare for... a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet. This time, Torfa. Soh-Larr sent us a warning. The signal was intercepted, and his cover\\'s blown. The Skrull general, Talos, has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do... the intelligence he\\'s acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The Accusers will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr... and we get out, leaving them none the wiser. The Torfan populace. We are not to interfere with them, nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him. This is a dangerous mission. We must all be ready to join the Collective if that is our fate today. For the good of all Kree. For the good of all Kree! Vers, track Soh-Larr\\'s beacon. Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation. Locals on the periphery. Maybe a dozen. Minn-Erva? Do you read me? Does anybody copy? Repeat. His beacon\\'s coming from that temple. Let\\'s move. No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush. Only one way in, only one way out. We can get past the locals. We don\\'t know if they are locals. Too risky. You don\\'t have to go with me. I\\'ll go alone. No, you won\\'t. Right. We keep a close radius. We lose comms, we meet back at the Helion. Come on. Att-Lass, you getting this? Copy. I see them. Get back! Commander? Get back! Back! Minn-Erva? Do you have eyes on this? Keep them back. Minn-Erva? Does anybody copy? I don\\'t wanna hurt you. Keep back! Stay back! They\\'re locals. I found two dead. No green. They\\'re just starving. HGX-78. TRT79-VVX6. Get back. Skrulls! Vers! Vers? Skrulls. It\\'s an ambush. Incoming! Back to the Helion. Vers. Do you copy? Back to the Helion. Come in. Vers. How did you know the code? How about I tell you my secret... when you\\'ve told me yours? Let\\'s open her up. Where are we? Stand by. Where\\'s your head at? In the clouds. Where\\'s yours? On my shoulders. About to show these boys how we do it. You ready? Higher, further, faster, baby. That\\'s right. This can\\'t be right. Go back even further. You\\'re going too fast! You need to go slow! Who is this person? Are we in the right...? What the hell are you thinking? You don\\'t belong out here! I think we went back too far. You let him drive. Let me try something. Give up already! You don\\'t belong out here! You\\'re not strong enough. You\\'ll kill yourself. They\\'ll never let you fly. Am I the only one that\\'s confused here? You\\'re a decent pilot. But you\\'re too emotional. You do know why they call it a cockpit, don\\'t you? A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon... and the sun and the stars in the sky. And so, little Alouette flew up throughout the night. Did you see her? It\\'s Alouette. Get your butts inside, it\\'s time to eat. Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble. Charming memory. Hang on. I think I\\'ve got it. Goose likes you. She doesn\\'t typically take to people. Early start to your morning. Uh, late night, actually. I can\\'t sleep when there\\'s work to do. Sound familiar? Flying your planes never feels like work. Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? I prefer the view from up there. You\\'ll get there soon enough, Ace. Wait! Wait, wait! That\\'s her. Get her back. Stand by. Sound familiar? Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? I prefer the view from up there. You\\'ll get there soon enough, Ace. What\\'s that on her shirt? I couldn\\'t read it. Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? I prefer the view from up there. - Focus. - Excuse me? Look down. Focus. \"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson.\" That\\'s her. Do you hear that, too? Do we have her location? Got it. Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature. Interesting. Huh. Hold on. Go back right before this. Go back. That\\'s no MiG, Lawson. This is it. Now let me see where you\\'re headed. That\\'s right. Look at the coordinates. Focus. Open, please. That\\'s it. That\\'s it. You\\'re almost there. You\\'re almost there. Don\\'t fight it. Focus! Get her back! Get her back now! This doesn\\'t make any sense. Do we have any information we can act on? Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53. We\\'re on our way. Then dig, dig, dig deeper. Lawson is our link to that light-speed engine! And everything we\\'re after. Oh! That did something. Try that again. Not yet! What did you do to me? Now we\\'re just after a little information. What did you put in my head? Nothing that wasn\\'t already there. But those aren\\'t my memories. Yeah, it\\'s like a bad trip, isn\\'t it? I\\'m not surprised you can\\'t keep it straight. They really did a number on you. Enough of your mind games. What do you want? We\\'re looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson... and her light-speed engine. I don\\'t know any Dr. Lawson. Really? Then why is she in your head? You guys wouldn\\'t happen to know how these things come off, would ya? No? Fine. Hmm. Hey. You do know why they call it a... You leaving so soon? We\\'re just getting to know each other. Vers to Starforce command, do you read me? Hello? Do you copy? Hi. I\\'m Vers. Kree Starforce. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working? Yeah. I understand you. Oh, good. Are you in charge of security for this district? Sort of. Uh, the movie theater has its own guy. Where can I find communications equipment? Thank you. Track the pod. Find the girl. She knows more than she knows. Hey. This one\\'s taken. Come on. Vers? Vers? Verify. CTC-39. GRXV-1600. And I\\'m fine, thank you for asking. Is everyone okay? What happened? Skrull ambush. I thought we\\'d lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr? It wasn\\'t Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him. Even knew his code. That\\'s impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious. The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used... I think it\\'s how they extracted Soh-Larr\\'s code. Vers, where are you? I\\'m on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson. Who? She\\'s who I see. She\\'s what? Vers? Vers, what? She\\'s a scientist. They think that she\\'s cracked the code on light-speed tech. I have to get to her before they do... or else they\\'ll be able to invade new galaxies. No. You\\'ve been caught once already. How far is C-53? Closest jump point is 22 hours. Vers, hold your position until we get there. Keep your comms online so we can contact you. No! What if they get a hold of it before... We\\'re sorry. A long-distance company access code is required for the number you have dialed. - Yon-Rogg? - Vers? Vers? Please dial your call with the access code. Vers? If the Skrulls got to her, she\\'s compromised. She\\'s stronger than you think. Ever been to C-53? Once. It\\'s a real shithole. Hey, rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop. Did you call this in? Beacon activated. Excuse me, miss. You know anything about a lady blowing a hole... through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she was dressed for laser tag. Oh. Yeah, I think she went that way. Uh, I\\'d like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box. Could I see some identification, please? Vers. Kree Starforce. We don\\'t carry our identification on little cards. Vers? Starforce? How long you plan to be in town? oh, I\\'ll be out of your hair... as soon as I track down the Skrulls that are infiltrating your planet. Skrulls? Shapeshifters? They can transform into any life-form down to the DNA. Oh, boy. You guys don\\'t have any clue, do you? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. How do we know you\\'re not one of those shapeshifters? Congratulations, Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question. No! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady. You\\'re under arrest. Rook! Rook, let\\'s roll! Did you see her weapon? I did not. Watch it! Suspect on northbound train. In pursuit. \"Trust me, true believer.\" \"Trust me.\" \"Trust me, true believer.\" Get off! Train\\'s heading for a tunnel up ahead. Let\\'s greet them at the station. Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson. Uh, I\\'m still here at the Blockbuster. And, uh, where\\'d everybody go? I finished collecting evidence... We need an ambulance! Someone call 911! Hey! You all right? Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay? Anyone else see that? Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity. Stay back. Nice scuba suit. Lighten up, honey, huh? Got a smile for me? Freak. All life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it\\'s not on the periodic table. You\\'re saying he\\'s not from around here? Hey, how\\'s your eye? Well, I\\'d say fine... but it can\\'t believe what it\\'s seeing. You say this thing looked like Coulson? Mmm. Talked like him, too. And the woman said that there were more? The word she used was \"infiltration.\" You believe her? Not till I saw this. What\\'s your plan? I\\'ll find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief that fits her description. If she can tell us why these lizards are here... maybe she can tell us how to kick \\'em to the curb. Good. Do it alone, though. We can\\'t trust anyone. Not even our own men. Yes, sir. Wow. They\\'re ugly bastards, aren\\'t they? Yeah, well, he\\'s no Brad Pitt, sir. Safe journey to the beyond, my friend. I will finish what we started. I wouldn\\'t get too close there, boss. No one in or out. Boom! What can I get ya? Where was this photograph taken? An airport. Where\\'s Pegasus? That\\'s classified. Not unlike the file I started on you. But I see you\\'ve changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you. Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury? It was cool, you know? Had a space invasion, big car chase. Got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical nine-to-five. So you saw one? I was never one to believe in aliens... but I can\\'t unsee that. This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask. You think I\\'m one of those green things. Can\\'t be too careful. You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man. I\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna need proof. We talking cheek swab or urine sample? No. The DNA would match. Want my AOL password? Skrulls can only sim recent memories - of their host bodies. - Oh, oh. You wanna get personal. - Where were you born? - Huntsville, Alabama. But technically, I don\\'t remember that part. - Name of your first pet? - Mr. Snoofers. - Mr. Snoofers? - That\\'s what I said. Do I pass? Not yet. First job? Soldier. Straight out of high school. Left the ranks a full bird colonel. - Then? - Spy. - Where? - It was the Cold War. We were everywhere. Uh, Belfast. Bucharest. Belgrade. Budapest. I like the B\\'s. I can make them rhyme. - Now? - Been riding a desk for the past six years... trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me they would be coming from above. Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it. If toast is cut diagonally, I can\\'t eat it. You didn\\'t need that, did you? No. No, I didn\\'t. But I enjoyed it. Okay. Your turn. Prove you\\'re not a Skrull. And how is that supposed to prove to me you\\'re not a Skrull? That\\'s a photon blast. And? A Skrull can\\'t do that. So, a full bird colonel turned spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent... must have pretty high security clearance. Where\\'s Pegasus? Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races to infiltrate and take over planets. And you\\'re a Kree? A race of noble warriors? Heroes. Noble warrior heroes. So, um, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson? They believe that she developed a light-speed engine at Pegasus. Light-speed engine? Gotta admit, that\\'s not the craziest thing I\\'ve heard today. Well, it\\'s still early. And you, what do you want? To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable. And? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one. You got a personal stake in this. This is government property. Turn your vehicle around. Nicholas Joseph Fury. Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Place your thumb on the pad. One moment. Nicholas Joseph Fury. You have three names? Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick. Just Fury. - What does your mom call you? - Fury. - What do you call her? - Fury. What about your kids? If I have them, they\\'ll call me Fury. You are cleared for access. Thank you. Oh, hold up. You look like somebody\\'s disaffected niece. Put that on. - What is it? - It\\'s the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo. Does, uh, announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job? Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit. Lose the flannel. How can I help you? We\\'re agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. We\\'re looking for a woman named Lawson. A Dr. Wendy Lawson. Do you know her? Follow me. Hmm. You familiar with the phrase \"welcome wagon\"? No. Well, this ain\\'t it. Is that a communicator? Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager. Who are you paging? My mom. Don\\'t worry. I didn\\'t mention you. After you. Impressive. Oh, you should see what I can do with a paperclip. Hey, there. How are you? Oh, my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren\\'t you the cutest little thing? Aren\\'t you cute? And what\\'s your name, huh? What\\'s your name? \"Goose.\" Cool name for a cool cat. Fury? Hmm? I\\'ll be back. Oh! Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy. You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... I didn\\'t wanna steal your thunder. Huh. Lawson. Lawson\\'s plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project. Um, maybe because she\\'s cuckoo. Kree glyphs? Hmm? Lawson is not cuckoo. She\\'s Kree. Well, she\\'s dead. What? She crashed the Asis aircraft doing an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That\\'s why security here is so unfriendly. They\\'re covering up a billion-dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast. When did this crash happen? Six years ago. 1989. Who was the pilot? Um, most of this thing\\'s redacted... but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them alive. You okay? Mm-hmm. Back in a minute. This isn\\'t about fighting wars. It\\'s about ending them. I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this? I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There\\'s only so much I\\'m cleared to tell you, Vers, but... Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war. She still here? She\\'s cooperating with the investigation, sir. - You men stay here. - Yes, sir. I want to question her alone. Excellent work, Nicholas. Does it say anything about me? Anything about you? No, of course not. Why would it? I found evidence that I had a life here. On C-53? Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson. This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers. No, it\\'s not. Because I remember. I was here. Stop. Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions override your judgment. She\\'s on sublevel six. I\\'ll get off on five... and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it. Do a pincer move like we did in Havana. Right. Like we did in Havana. We\\'re nearing the jump point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We\\'ll get to the bottom of this, Vers. Together. Okay. Vers! Vers! Fury\\'s colluding with the target. Then why would he call us in? All I know is we take him in, too. Dead or alive. Dead or alive? Go. Go, go! Was it something I said? Mmm-mmm. Now, you know, I don\\'t really need these to see... but they do kinda complete the look. Don\\'t you think? You called them in? My bad. Coulson, do you have eyes on them? They\\'re not down here. Let\\'s try up there. - What? - Your communicator. You obviously can\\'t be trusted with it. Do you know how to fly this thing? Uh, we\\'ll see. That\\'s a yes or no question. Yes. That\\'s what I\\'m talking about! We got a stowaway. Hang on, Goose. Goose. No, Goose. Who\\'s a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose? Yes, that\\'s right. Who\\'s a good kitty, Goose? You the good kitty, that\\'s right. See anyone you know? Funny story. I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory. That was six years ago. So, you think you\\'re the pilot that went down with Dr. Lawson? I\\'m saying the last person to see them alive could probably tell us. - Maria Rambeau? - Mm-hmm. So, how do we get to Louisiana? Due east. Hang a right at Memphis. That agent... that stopped the Skrulls from finding us? Coulson. The new guy. I guess he doesn\\'t hate me yet. Yeah, well, give him time. I guess he had a feeling, you know? Went with his gut against orders. That\\'s a really hard thing to do. But it\\'s what keeps us human. I get in trouble for that. A lot. Oh, I can see that about you. Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls? I\\'m guessing that\\'s not standard Kree operating procedure. Well, I won\\'t tell your boss if you don\\'t tell mine. Ronan. The Accusers completed their operation... but the greater mission was a failure, thanks to your team. It was a trap to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her. Give us their location. We\\'ll take care of the terrorist threat. By bombing them out of the galaxy? No, we\\'ll handle this. A cell of Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they? - They are... - Lost. They are lost for now. But we will find them. Do so, or we will. Maintain the course for C-53. Excuse me, I\\'m looking for Maria Rambeau. Auntie Carol? Mom, it\\'s Auntie Carol! I knew it! Everyone said you were dead! But we knew they were lying. I\\'m not really who you think I am. That is the craziest shit I ever heard. Green transforming aliens? There\\'s no such thing. You are absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. \\'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves. You don\\'t believe me? No way! That\\'s so cool! Oh, she can do a lot more than make tea with those hands. Like what? Show us. Maybe later. I kept all your stuff. I\\'ll go get it. You want to give her a hand with that? Hmm? You don\\'t remember anything? I see flashes. Little moments. But I can\\'t tell what\\'s real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning... maybe it\\'ll all make sense. You woke me up banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then, we had to get up so early. The Air Force still wasn\\'t letting women fly combat... so testing Lawson\\'s planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang... and I wasn\\'t about to argue, \\'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut. Since when is a shortcut cheating? Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement. I definitely don\\'t remember those. Hmm. Of course you don\\'t. When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated. She said she had lives to save. She was trying to take the Asis up herself, but you said that... If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane. Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we\\'d both been waiting for. The doc was always unique. That\\'s why we liked her. But now you\\'re saying she\\'s from another planet. I know this must be hard for you. Oh, what? This part right here? No. No. Mmm-mmm. Oh, what\\'s hard is losing my best friend... in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after six years... with your supercharged fire hands... and you expect me to call you... I don\\'t even know what. Vers? Is that really who you are now? I don\\'t know. Come look! This is me and you on Halloween. I\\'m Amelia Earhart and you\\'re Janis Joplin. Oh, this is you when you were little. You didn\\'t get along with your parents... so Mom said we became your real family. This is us on Christmas. I got my favorite bunny slippers. This is another picture of you when you were little. You\\'ve always wanted to be a pilot. And this is right after you graduated. This was your dog that you got for Christmas... This is a picture of everybody from your Air Force team. And this is you with Mom right after a good day of training. These were your three favorite guys. Oh, wait. I forgot. Your jacket. Mom doesn\\'t let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it. That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought. Don\\'t answer that. It\\'s just my neighbor. They can change into anyone. Hi there. What do you want? - Uh... - Hey, Tom. This is my friend, Carol. Oh. Pleased to meet you. Yowzers. Static electricity out here\\'s no joke. I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road... and I was just wondering... if you mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer look-see? - A closer look-see? - Yeah. To see the \"bird\" parked out by the road? Mmm. You\\'re really working overtime to sell this one, aren\\'t you, Talos? I\\'m sorry, Tom. This really isn\\'t a good time. I\\'ll come by tomorrow, okay? - Uh... - Okay. You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you\\'re gonna need to borrow some sugar. Now, hang on a second. Before you go swinging those jazz hands around... making a mess of your friend\\'s house... It\\'s a lovely home, miss. Oh, my God! What the hell? No one\\'s gonna hurt the girl. Just don\\'t kill me. That would really complicate the situation. I\\'m about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains. I\\'m sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception. And who is that out there? Okay, that\\'s a fair point... but I\\'m sure that you understand I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk. Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles. That was before I knew who you were. Before I knew what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus... of your voice from a plane crash six years ago... on a device I believe you call a \"black box.\" They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How\\'d you get it? She don\\'t understand. Young lady, I have a special skill... that kind of allows me to get into places I\\'m not supposed to be. Call me \"young lady\" again... I\\'m gonna put my foot in a place it\\'s not supposed to be. Am I supposed to guess where that is? Your ass. Okay, I get it. We\\'re all a little on edge here. But, look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you\\'ll sit down and you\\'ll listen to this... I assure you, it\\'ll be worth your while. Call your buddy back inside and I\\'ll listen. Deal. Oh, my God! Get that thing away. How\\'d that get in here? Hmm? The cat? This isn\\'t what you\\'re afraid of, is it? That\\'s not a cat. - That\\'s a Flerken. - A Flerken? Mom? Monica. - Why can\\'t I listen, too? - Shh! What\\'s happening? It\\'s loading. Punch in the coordinates 5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2. Copy that. Where are we going, Doc? My laboratory. Your laboratory? What do you mean? Oh, no. Is that... Wait, what is that? It\\'s not showing up on my radar. Go, Carol. Fly! That\\'s no MiG, Lawson. Who the hell are they? Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now! Yes, ma\\'am. - What do they want? - Me. My work. I never should have brought you along. Here come some G\\'s. They\\'re firing backwards. Hold on! Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me, Lawson! Carol, come in. Do you copy? Yeah, I copy. We hit ground. Carol, are you okay? Do you copy? Yeah! I copy. Doc? Your blood. It\\'s blue. Yeah, but, uh, how\\'s my hair? Help me out, will ya? I gotta destroy it before they get here. Lawson? You remember what I said about our work here? What it\\'s for? To end wars? Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name is Mar-Vell, and I come from a planet called Hala. I would say that you\\'re delusional... but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue. Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now, skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You gotta save \\'em without me. Save who? How? Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it. What are you doing? We have no interest in hurting you. No? \\'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression! The energy core. Where is it? Pararescue\\'s on the way. You have two minutes until you\\'re surrounded. Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation. No, wait! You mean that energy core? No! Commander? She\\'s still moving. Permission to fire. Hold your fire. There\\'s nothing left. The core has been destroyed. She absorbed its power. She\\'s coming with us. He lied to me. Everything that I knew was a lie. Now, you understand. What? What do I understand now? Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her... \\'cause she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war. No. Your people are terrorists. They kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa. Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule... and they destroyed our planet. And the handful of us that are left will be slaughtered next... unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The core that she found would have powered a light-speed ship... capable of carrying us to safety. A new home where the Kree can\\'t reach us. Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus wasn\\'t to fight wars... but to end them. She wanted you to help us find the core. Well, I already destroyed it. No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates... we can find it. You\\'ll use it to destroy us. We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can\\'t you see it now? You\\'re not one of them. You don\\'t know me. You have no idea who I am. I don\\'t even know who I am! You are Carol Danvers. You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother and a pilot when no one else did. You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass... and you were the most powerful person I knew... way before you could shoot fire from your fists. You hear me? Do you hear me? Come here. Come here, girl. I got you. I know I don\\'t deserve your trust... but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell\\'s core. Now we know why. If only you knew the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell\\'s lab. Those weren\\'t coordinates. They\\'re state vectors. For orbital position and velocity. You didn\\'t find her lab on Earth, \\'cause it\\'s not on Earth. That was the location on the date of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we\\'ll find it in orbit right now. It\\'s just basic physics. In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you\\'re my science guy, right? Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon. We\\'ve got to get to the core before he does. Mmm. We\\'re going to space? In what? A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications. Mmm. Your science guy. Well, I could use a copilot. No. No, I can\\'t. I can\\'t leave Monica. Mom, it\\'s okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw. There\\'s no way I\\'m going, baby. It\\'s too dangerous. Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous... and you used to do that. Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey... and you anticipate hostile encounters... with a technologically-superior foreign enemy. Correct? That\\'s what I\\'m saying. - You have to go! - Monica! You have a chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions... and you\\'re gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? What? I just think you should consider... what kind of example you\\'re setting for your daughter. What\\'s going on around here? I know, I know. I\\'ll explain inside. Thank you. Your mom\\'s lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble. You remembered. Is that mine? No, no. You hang on to it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can\\'t wear these Kree colors anymore. And since you are obviously the only person around here with any sense of style... Hmm? Whoa. No. Uh-uh. Definitely not. Well, since we\\'re on the same team... Hmm. How do I look? Fresh. What took you so long? I\\'m fine. Thanks for asking. - PRY46-B... - No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we\\'ve learned. Okay, then let\\'s do this. Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence? The person you most admire and respect, I\\'d guess. But you would never tell me who. And what is your earliest memory of Hala? The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins. Whose blood? Hmm. That\\'s my blood that\\'s coursing through her veins. What have you done with her? You\\'re too late. She knows? Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once. For the good of all Kree, Commander... the infestation will be eradicated. Passing 500 and climbing. You know, you really shouldn\\'t have that thing on your lap. Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out... like that... yeah, I\\'m gonna keep giving him all the loves and hugs that he needs, right? Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want? Ah, well, I have to see it first. Can you all do it? Physiologically? Yeah. But, uh, it takes practice... and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well. - Can you turn into a cat? - What\\'s a cat? What about a filing cabinet? Why would I turn into a filing cabinet? A Venus flytrap? I\\'ll give you 50 bucks right now if you turn into a Venus flytrap. Switching engines from Scramjet to Fusion. Buckle up, folks. Hey. Is this normal, like, space turbulence? Pretty much. Locking in on coordinate grid. Where is it? It\\'s here. It\\'s gotta be here. Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it? Decloaking activated. Is that it? The core? In her notes she called it the Tesseract. Whoa. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff? We\\'re not alone. Talos! He didn\\'t come here for the Tesseract. It\\'s okay. We didn\\'t know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason... or the Kree would find us. You did the right thing. It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. She\\'s all right. She\\'s a friend. I am not gonna hurt you. She led me to you. I\\'m so sorry. I didn\\'t know. Carol. This is war. My hands are filthy from it, too. But we\\'re here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There are thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy. If I played the same pinball machine for six years... I\\'d have some high scores, too. Fraternizing with the enemy? Uh-uh. What did you do to your uniform? They got in her head. Just like we thought. The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight. You can see they\\'re not soldiers. Let \\'em go. You can have me. And the core? You lied to me. I made you the best version of yourself. What\\'s given can be taken away. Back here! Move, move! Get over here. Get down! Let\\'s go! Go, move! There she is. Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket. It\\'s killer, by the way. Oh. The music. It\\'s a nice touch. Let me out. No can do. If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground. With what exactly? Your power comes from us. You didn\\'t give me these powers. The blast did. And yet, you\\'ve never had the strength to control them on your own. Species: Flerken. Threat: high. It\\'s a cat, not Hannibal Lecter. Species: human male. Threat: low to none. That thing\\'s clearly busted. Load the Flerken onto the Helion. Eject the others into space. You did good, Ace. Thanks to you... those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more. I used to believe your lies... but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You\\'re talking about destroying them because they won\\'t submit to your rule. And neither will I. We found you. We embraced you as our own. You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends. It\\'s cute how hard you try. But remember... without us... Give it up, Carol. Stay down! ...you\\'re weak. You\\'re going too fast! You need to go slow! You\\'re flawed. Are you trying to kill yourself? Helpless. You\\'re too emotional and so weak. You don\\'t belong out here! We saved you. - Control it. - I told you, - Carol. - They\\'ll never - let you fly. - This ain\\'t - a game for little girls. - You kiss like a horse. You won\\'t last a week, Danvers. Without us, you\\'re only human. You\\'re right. I\\'m only human. On Hala, you were reborn... Vers. My name is Carol. She\\'s trying to break out. I\\'ve been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens when... I\\'m finally set free? You know you\\'re glowing, right? I\\'ll explain it later. Take the Tesseract. Leave the lunchbox. - Me? - Yes. I\\'m not touching that thing. You want me to get you an oven mitt? Whoa! Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go. Take the Flerken with you. - What about you? - I\\'ll buy you some time! I\\'m picking you up now. I\\'m trusting you not to eat me. Oh, hey, guys. Arm wrestle for the Tesseract? I used to find you amusing. Let\\'s put an end to this. Okay. Good kitty. You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out? No, I just never liked you. Incoming! Hey, in a hurry? Don\\'t make me do this. Okay. Come on, do your thing! Come on! Come on! Damn it, Goose. Pick a side. Take them to the hangar, too. We\\'ll blast them all into space. Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing? Flerken kitty ate it. Come on, move! Move! Follow my lead. Cover her eyes. Onto the ship! Let\\'s go! Let\\'s go! Nice diversion. I could have swore I put it in there. Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship. On it. You all right, friend? Never better. We got a bogey coming in hot. Yes! Boom! Whoo! What the hell was that? Deploy ballistic warheads. That\\'s impossible. C-53 doesn\\'t have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads. That\\'s not their defense system, Ronan. Take her down. Whoo! Return to the jump point. We\\'ll be back for the weapon. The core? The woman. I\\'m so proud of you. You\\'ve come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will they get the better of you as always? I always told you... you\\'ll be ready the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show... and prove to me you can beat me without... I have nothing to prove to you. Destination: Hala. I can\\'t go back empty-handed. You won\\'t be empty-handed. I\\'m sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I\\'m coming to end it. The war. The lies. All of it. You can\\'t do this. That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? Those bad guys still in there somewhere? Ow! Mother Flerken! - You okay? - Yeah. It\\'s just a scratch. No. I can\\'t believe you got in the raddest dogfight ever... and I missed it. I\\'d say you arrived just in time. Some nifty flying you did out there. S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you. I\\'ll consider it... as long as you never call my flying \"nifty\" again. How\\'s your eye? Hmm. Getting better every second. Just so I\\'m clear... you were Soh-Larr... - and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller. He tied my boss up, stole his identity. I borrowed his likeness. I\\'m no thief. It is a little like stealing. Whose side are you on here? You\\'re good to go here until you recover... but you and your family are gonna need a new look. I could go back to being your boss. Uh, please don\\'t. Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes. No way. You guys have the best eyes. Don\\'t ever change your eyes. She has beautiful eyes. That\\'s very sweet of you. I was trying not to panic... I\\'ll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started. They can stay here with us. Can\\'t they, Mom? They won\\'t be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol\\'s right. They need their own home. I\\'ll be back before you know it. Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway? Ah, only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol. Or maybe I\\'ll build a spaceship. - You don\\'t know. - He doesn\\'t. Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden. You sure that\\'s what Marvel would want? Mar-Vell. That\\'s what I said. It\\'s two words. Mar. Vell. Mar-Vell. \"Marvel\" sounds a lot better. You know, like the Marvelettes. Not ringing any bells? Keep singing. Maybe it\\'ll come back to me. I upgraded it. Range should be a couple galaxies, at least. What? You think I\\'m gonna crank call you? For emergencies only, okay? Well... if you\\'re ever passing back through this galaxy... be sure to give a brother a shout. Oh! We got the ketchup stain off. Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble. Hmm. It\\'s hard for me to say goodbye, too. Go on. Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you. So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out... because you refused to give them the Tesseract? I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story. Understood. I\\'m sorry to report that we still haven\\'t found the Tesseract. I\\'m sure it\\'ll turn up somewhere. I\\'ll let you know when it does. Then what? Sir? We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment... on the other side of the universe. S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can\\'t protect us. We need to find more. More weapons? More heroes. You think you can find others like her? Hmm, we found her, and we weren\\'t even looking. Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make. This is a nightmare. I\\'ve had better nightmares. Hey. So, that thing just stopped doing whatever the hell it was doing. What do we got? Whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out. I thought we bypassed the battery. We did. It\\'s still plugged in. It just stopped. Reboot it. Send the signal again. We don\\'t even know what this is. Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I wanna know who\\'s on the other end of that thing. Where\\'s Fury?

You just fight for yourself. Who\\'s going to avenge my son, Stark? He\\'s dead... and I blame you. FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation... between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries... in Lagos, Nigeria last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission... in Lagos, when the attack occurred. Our people\\'s blood is spilled on foreign soil... not only because of the actions of criminals... but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent... is no victory at all. FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: The Wakandan king went on to... MALE PUNDIT: (ON TV) They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that\\'s the reality, if we don\\'t respond to acts like these. What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have... to operate in Nigeri...? It\\'s my fault. That\\'s not true. Turn the TV back on. They\\'re being very specific. I should\\'ve clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it. Rumlow said \"BUCKY\"... and all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. And people died. It\\'s on me. It\\'s on both of us. This job... We try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn\\'t mean everybody. But if we can\\'t find a way to live with that... then next time... maybe nobody gets saved. Vis! We talked about this. Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that... Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr Stark was arriving. Thank you. We\\'ll be right down. I\\'ll use the door. Oh, and apparently, he\\'s brought a guest. STEVE: We know who it is? The Secretary of State. SECRETARY ROSS: (SIGHS) Five years ago... I had a heart attack... and dropped right in the middle of my backswing. Turned out it was the best round of my life... because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass... I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me. Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt. You have fought for us... protected us, risked your lives... but while a great many people see you as heroes... there are some... who would prefer the word \"vigilantes.\" What word would you use, Mr Secretary? How about \"dangerous\"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals... who routinely ignore sovereign borders... and inflict their will wherever they choose... and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind? New York. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Washington, D.C. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Sokovia. Lagos. (SIREN WAILING) Okay. That\\'s enough. For the past four years, you\\'ve operated with unlimited power... and no supervision. That\\'s an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries... it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead... they\\'ll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel... only when and if that panel deems it necessary. The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we\\'ve done that. Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now? If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes... you can bet there\\'d be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That\\'s how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground. So, there are contingencies. Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna... to ratify the Accords. Talk it over. And if we come to a decision you don\\'t like? Then you retire. (VEHICLE CRASHING) MAN: Hello? Is this your car out front? I jumped the kerb. Maybe we could... take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, that\\'s okay, too... - I guess. - No. No cops. Thank you. (CLATTERS) (KARPOV STRAINING) You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations. \"Mission report. December 16, 1991.\" Who are you? My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report, December 16, 1991. How did you find me? When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell... Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted. Not easy to decipher. But, I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those. What do you want? Mission report. December 16. 1991. Go... to... hell! (BREATHING HEAVILY) HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I\\'d have to use this book... and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don\\'t look forward to that. You\\'d only be dying for... your pride. Hail HYDRA. (CHOKING) Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honour... which is one more than you have. SAM: So let\\'s say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals? 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you\\'re just like, \"No, that\\'s cool. We got it.\" How long are you going to play both sides? I have an equation. Oh, this will clear it up. In the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man... the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. During the same period... the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate. Are you saying it\\'s our fault? I\\'m saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand. Boom. NATASHA: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal. It\\'s because he\\'s already made up his mind. Boy, you know me so well. Actually, I\\'m nursing an electromagnetic headache. That\\'s what\\'s going on, Cap. It\\'s just pain. It\\'s discomfort. Who\\'s putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? (SIGHS) Oh, that\\'s Charles Spencer, by the way. He\\'s a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA... had a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul... before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn\\'t want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn\\'t go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where. Sokovia. He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. We won\\'t know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. There\\'s no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I\\'m game. If we can\\'t accept limitations, if we\\'re boundary-less... we\\'re no better than the bad guys. Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don\\'t give up. Who said we\\'re giving up? We are if we\\'re not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blame. I\\'m sorry, Steve. That is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we\\'re talking about. It\\'s not the World Security Council, it\\'s not S.H.I.E.L.D., it\\'s not HYDRA. No, but it\\'s run by people with agendas, and agendas change. That\\'s good. That\\'s why I\\'m here. When I realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands... I shut it down and stopped manufacturing. Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don\\'t think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don\\'t let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own. If we don\\'t do this now, it\\'s gonna be done to us later. That\\'s the fact. That won\\'t be pretty. You\\'re saying they\\'ll come for me. We would protect you. NATASHA: Maybe Tony\\'s right. If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off... Aren\\'t you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago? I\\'m just reading the terrain. We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back. Focus up. I\\'m sorry. Did I just mishear you... - or did you agree with me? - I want to take it back now. No, you can\\'t retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. (MOBILE BUZZING) Okay. Case closed. I win. I have to go. (CHOIR SINGING HYMN) And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words. (EXHALES SHAKILY) Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D... but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy. She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related. I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage... in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. She said, compromise where you can. But where you can\\'t, don\\'t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move... it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree... look them in the eye and say \"No, you move.\" When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out she was alive. I was just lucky to have her. She had you back, too. Who else signed? Tony, Rhodey, Vision. Clint? Says he\\'s retired. - Wanda? - TBD. I\\'m off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There\\'s plenty of room on the jet. (SIGHS) Just because it\\'s the path of least resistance... doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. What are we giving up to do it? (SIGHS) I\\'m sorry, Nat. I can\\'t sign it. I know. Then what are you doing here? I didn\\'t want you to be alone. Come here. MALE NEWS ANCHOR: At a special United Nations conference... 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords. UN STAFFER: Excuse me, Ms Romanoff? - NATASHA: Yes? - These need your signature. - Thank you. - Thanks. T\\'CHALLA: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight. Oh, well, it\\'s not always so flattering. You seem to be doing all right so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill... I wouldn\\'t think you\\'d be particularly comfortable in this company. Well, I\\'m not. And that alone makes me glad you are here, Ms Romanoff. Why? You don\\'t approve of all this? The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred. Unless you need to move a piano. (BOTH SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) Ms Romanoff. King T\\'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologise for what happened in Nigeria. Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all of this. I\\'m sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today. Yes, so am I. MAN: (ON SPEAKERS) If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session. That is the future calling. Such a pleasure. Thank you. (BOTH SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you\\'re getting quite good at it. I\\'m happy, Father. Thank you. Thank you. KING T\\'CHAKA: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon... we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria... were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. Wakanda is proud - to extend its hand in peace. - (DOG BARKING) Everybody get down! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (INAUDIBLE) (SOBBING) SHARON: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting... but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster. Very practical. And stylish. CIA has you stationed over here now? Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force. Right. Right. Sounds fun. I know, right? I\\'ve been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall... You mean when I was doing my job. Did Peggy know? She kept so many secrets. I didn\\'t want her to have one from you. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Thanks for walking me back. Sure. SAM: Steve. There\\'s something you gotta see. MALE NEWS ANCHOR: A bomb hidden in a news van... SHARON: Who\\'s coordinating? Ripped through the UN building in Vienna. Good. They\\'re solid. Forensics? More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda\\'s King T\\'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect... who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes... the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent... linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations. I have to go to work. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Call MI6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it\\'s not worth it. I\\'m very sorry. T\\'CHALLA: In my culture... death is not the end. It\\'s more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands... and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt... where you can run forever. That sounds very peaceful. My father thought so. I am not my father. T\\'CHALLA... Task Force will decide who brings in Barnes. Don\\'t bother, Ms Romanoff. I\\'ll kill him myself. (SIGHS) (MOBILE RINGING) Yeah? You all right? Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You\\'ll only make this worse. For all of us. Please. Are you saying you\\'ll arrest me? No. Someone will. If you interfere. That\\'s how it works now. If he\\'s this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in. Why? Because I\\'m the one least likely to die trying. Shit. She tell you to stay out of it? Might have a point. He\\'d do it for me. 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we consider all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier goes to their gym. Most of it\\'s noise. Except for this. My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now... so that\\'s all the head start you\\'re gonna get. Thank you. SHARON: You\\'re gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight. (HELMUT ZEMO PRACTICING RUSSIAN) Homecoming One One Freight car (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN) I have your breakfast. (SIGHS) I could smell it before I opened the door. Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like. This is wonderful... I will just put this on your... It\\'s okay, I can manage! (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SIREN WAILING) SAM: (ON RADIO) Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south. Understood. Do you know me? You\\'re Steve. I read about you in a museum. SAM: They\\'ve set the perimeter. I know you\\'re nervous, and you have plenty of reason to be. But you\\'re lying. I wasn\\'t in Vienna. I don\\'t do that any more. They\\'re entering the building. Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they\\'re not planning on taking you alive. That\\'s smart. Good strategy. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) They\\'re on the roof. I\\'m compromised. This doesn\\'t have to end in a fight, Buck. - It always ends in a fight. - Five seconds. You pulled me from the river. Why? - I don\\'t know. - Three seconds. Yes, you do. Breach! Breach! Breach! (SHOUTING IN GERMAN) Buck, stop! You\\'re gonna kill someone. I\\'m not gonna kill anyone. (SOLDIER SHOUTING IN GERMAN) Suspect has broken containment! He\\'s headed down the east stairwell! Come on, man. (YELPS) Ahhh! (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) Sam, southwest rooftop. SAM: Who the hell\\'s the other guy? About to find out. - Sam. - Got him.

(SIRENS WAILING) (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (TYRES SCREECHING) (SIRENS CONTINUE WAILING) Stand down, now. Congratulations, Cap. You\\'re a criminal. (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Your Highness. \"A pinch of paprika.\" A pinch. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Is that paprikash? I thought it might lift your spirits. (WANDA CHUCKLES) Spirits lifted. In my defense, I haven\\'t actually ever eaten anything before, so... May I? Please. - Wanda? - Hmm. No one dislikes you, Wanda. Thanks. Oh, you\\'re welcome. No, it\\'s a involuntary response in their amygdala. They can\\'t help but be afraid of you. Are you? My amygdala is synthetic, so... (LAUGHS) I used to think of myself one way. But after this... I am something else. I\\'m still me, I think, but... that\\'s not what everyone else sees. Do you know, I don\\'t know what this is? Not really. I know it\\'s not of this world... that it powered Loki\\'s staff, gave you your abilities, but... its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me. Are you afraid of it? I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day... who knows? I may even control it. I don\\'t know what\\'s in this but it is not paprika. I\\'m gonna go to the store. I\\'ll be back in 20 minutes. Alternatively, we could order a pizza? Vision, are you not letting me leave? It is a question of safety. I can protect myself. Not yours. Mr Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a more secure foundation. And what do you want? For people to see you... as I do. (SIRENS WAILING) So, you like cats? - Sam. - SAM: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat, you don\\'t wanna know more? Your suit... it\\'s vibranium? The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father... I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you... as both warrior and king... how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? (MAN SPEAKING GERMAN ON PA) What\\'s gonna happen to him? Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition. This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander. What about a lawyer? Lawyer. That\\'s funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. We\\'ll write you a receipt. I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. (MAN ON PA CONTINUES IN GERMAN) EVERETT: You\\'ll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favour, stay in it? I don\\'t intend on going anywhere. For the record, this is what making things worse looks like. He\\'s alive. TONY: No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup. Try not to break anything while we fix this. Consequences? You bet there\\'ll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that, because I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir. \"Consequences\"? Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something. I\\'m not getting that shield back, am I? Technically, it\\'s the government\\'s property. Wings, too. That\\'s cold. Warmer than jail. (SPEAKING GERMAN) TONY: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad\\'s archives. Felt timely. FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most. Some would say it brought our country closer to war. See? If not for these, you wouldn\\'t be here. I\\'m trying to... What do you call it? That\\'s an olive branch. Is that what you call it? Is Pepper here? I didn\\'t see her. We\\'re kinda... - Well, not kinda... - Pregnant? No. Definitely not. We\\'re taking a break. It\\'s nobody\\'s fault. I\\'m so sorry, Tony. I didn\\'t know. A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA... and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don\\'t wanna stop. I don\\'t wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. In her defense, I\\'m a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work. STEVE: I\\'m glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single. Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you. I don\\'t mean to make things difficult. I know, because you\\'re a very polite person. If I see a situation pointed south... I can\\'t ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could. No, you don\\'t. No, I don\\'t. Sometimes... Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don\\'t wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing\\'s happened that can\\'t be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-centre... instead of a Wakandan prison. I\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible... but there would have to be safeguards. Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I\\'d file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated... Wanda? What about Wanda? She\\'s fine. She\\'s confined to the compound, currently. Vision\\'s keeping her company. Oh, God, Tony. Every time I think you see things the right way... It\\'s 100 acres with a lap pool. It\\'s got a screening room. There\\'s worse ways to protect people. Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It\\'s internment, Tony. - She\\'s not a US citizen. - Oh, come on, Tony. And they don\\'t grant visas to weapons of mass destruction. She\\'s a kid! Give me a break! I\\'m doing what has to be done. To stave off something worse. You keep telling yourself that. Hate to break up the set. HELMUT ZEMO: Hello, Mr Barnes. I\\'ve been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James? The receipt for your gear. \"Bird costume\"? Come on. I didn\\'t write it. HELMUT ZEMO: I\\'m not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can\\'t help you if you don\\'t talk to me, James. My name is BUCKY. (HONKING) Hello? Hey! (BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN) Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with? Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can? Right. It\\'s a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier. You\\'re saying someone framed him to find him? Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing. We didn\\'t bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads. SHARON: Yeah, but that doesn\\'t guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. Yeah. HELMUT ZEMO: Tell me, BUCKY. You\\'ve seen a great deal, haven\\'t you? I don\\'t wanna talk about it. You fear that if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don\\'t worry. We only have to talk about one. (BEEPING) (SPEAKING GERMAN) Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

(CHUCKLES) Can\\'t read that in a museum. Just like that, we\\'re supposed to be cool? What did I do? Enough. Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words. - Who was he? - I don\\'t know. People are dead. The bombing, the setup... the doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than \"I don\\'t know.\" He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where. Why would he need to know that? Because I\\'m not the only Winter Soldier. (GROANING) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) It hurts! (GROANING CONTINUES) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Good work. (PANTING) (SCREAMING) (COCKS GUN) Get me out of here. Who were they? BUCKY: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum. They all turn out like you? Worse. The doctor, could he control them? Enough. Said he wanted to see an empire fall. BUCKY: With these guys, he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight... infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize. They can take a whole country down in one night, you\\'d never see them coming. This would have been a lot easier a week ago. - If we call Tony... - No, he won\\'t believe us. Even if he did... Who knows if the Accords would let him help. We\\'re on our own. Maybe not. I know a guy. I don\\'t suppose you have any idea where they are? TONY: We will. GSG 9\\'s got the borders covered. Recon\\'s flying 24/7. They\\'ll get a hit. We\\'ll handle it. You don\\'t get it, Stark. It\\'s not yours to handle. It\\'s clear you can\\'t be objective. I\\'m putting Special Ops on this. What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers? SECRETARY ROSS: If we\\'re provoked. Barnes would\\'ve been eliminated in Romania if it wasn\\'t for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math. All due respect, you\\'re not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in. How would that end any differently than last time? Because this time, I won\\'t be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed. 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson. Thank you, sir. (EXHALES) My left arm is numb. Is that normal? You all right? Always. 36 hours. Jeez. We\\'re seriously understaffed. Oh, yeah. It\\'d be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot? You really think he\\'d be on our side? No. I have an idea. Me, too.

You\\'ve been getting my emails, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - Right? Regarding the... You didn\\'t even tell me about the grant. - About the grant. - The September Foundation. - Right. - Yeah. Remember when you applied? Yeah. I approved, so now we\\'re in business. But you didn\\'t tell me anything. What\\'s up with that? You keeping secrets from me now? I just know how much you love surprises so I thought I would let you know... Anyway, what did I apply for? That\\'s what I\\'m here to hash out. Okay. Hash it out, okay. It\\'s so hard for me to believe that she\\'s someone\\'s aunt. Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know? This walnut date loaf is exceptional. - Let me just stop you there. - Yeah. Is this grant got money involved or whatever? No? TONY: Yeah, it\\'s pretty well funded. Yeah? Wow. Look who you\\'re talking to. - Can I have five minutes with him? - Sure. As walnut date loaves go, that wasn\\'t bad. Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army? - Uh, the garbage, actually. - You\\'re a dumpster diver? Yeah, I was... Anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant... - Ah-ah! Me first. - Okay. Quick question of the rhetorical variety. That\\'s you, right? Um, no. - (STAMMERS) What do you mean? - Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That\\'s not easy. You got mad skills. That\\'s all on YouTube, though, right? That\\'s where you found that? Because you know that\\'s all fake. It\\'s all done on the computer. Mmm-hmm. It\\'s like that video. What is it? Yeah. Oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix? Exactly. Oh, what have we here? - Uh... - (CLATTERS) (EXHALES) You\\'re the Spider-ling. Crime-fighting spider. You\\'re Spider-Boy? Spider-Man. Not in that onesie, you\\'re not. It\\'s not a onesie. I don\\'t believe this. I was actually having a really good day today, Mr Stark. Didn\\'t miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there... and Algebra test, nailed it. Who else knows? Anybody? Nobody. Not even your unusually attractive aunt? No. No. No! If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out. You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that? I did. Climbing walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves? It\\'s a long story. I was... Lordy! Can you even see in these? Yes, I can. I\\'m blind! I can see in those. Okay? It\\'s just that when whatever happened, happened... it\\'s like my senses have been dialled to 11. There\\'s way too much input, so they just kinda help me focus. You\\'re in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom, hundred-point restoration. That\\'s why I\\'m here. Why you doing this? I gotta know, what\\'s your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning? Because... (STAMMERS) Because I\\'ve been me my whole life, and I\\'ve had these powers for six months. Mmm-hmm. I read books, I build computers. Yeah, I would love to play football, but I couldn\\'t then, so I shouldn\\'t now. Sure, because you\\'re different. Exactly. But I can\\'t tell anybody that, so I\\'m not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don\\'t... and then the bad things happen... they happen because of you. So you wanna look out for the little guy, you wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right? Yeah, just looking out for the little guy. That\\'s what it is. I\\'m gonna sit here, so you move the leg. (TONY EXHALES) You got a passport? No, I don\\'t even have a driver\\'s license. - You ever been to Germany? - No. Oh, you\\'ll love it. - I can\\'t go to Germany. - Why? I got homework. I\\'m gonna pretend you didn\\'t say that. No, I\\'m being serious. I can\\'t just drop out of school. Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I\\'m taking you on a field trip. Don\\'t tell Aunt May. All right, Spider-Man. Get me out of this. Sorry. I\\'ll get the... (EXPLOSION) What is it? Stay here, please. (GASPS) Guess I shoulda knocked. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? Disappointing my kids. I\\'m supposed to go waterskiing. Cap needs our help. Come on. Clint! You should not be here. Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit. Please consider the consequences of your actions. Okay, they\\'re considered. (GROANS) Okay, we gotta go. It\\'s this way. I\\'ve caused enough problems. (SIGHS) You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, you can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. (GROANS) I knew I should\\'ve stretched. (BOTH GRUNTING) VISION: Clint, you can\\'t overpower me. I know I can\\'t. But she can. Vision, that\\'s enough. Let him go. I\\'m leaving. I can\\'t let you. I\\'m sorry. If you do this... they will never stop being afraid of you. I can\\'t control their fear, only my own. CLINT: Oh... Come on. We got one more stop. ATTACHE: It\\'s just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, biometric, and behavioural pattern scans. Move or you will be moved. As entertaining as that would be... You really think you can find him? My resources are considerable. Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes... so you could probably do that in about half the time. You know where they are. I know someone who does. Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car. It\\'s low profile. Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. Can you move your seat up? No. I owe you again. Keeping a list. You know, he kinda tried to kill me. Sorry. I\\'ll put it on the list, too. They\\'re going to come looking for you. I know. Thank you, Sharon. That was... Late. Damn right. I should go. Okay. Cap. You know I wouldn\\'t have called if I had any other choice. Hey, man, you\\'re doing me a favour. Besides, I owe a debt. Thanks for having my back. It was time to get off my ass. How about our other recruit? He\\'s rarin\\' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him... (CAR DOOR SLAMS) but he should be good. What time zone is this? Come on. Come on. - Captain America! - Mr Lang. It\\'s an honour. I\\'m shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. I know you, too. You\\'re great! Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so... thinks for thanking of me. - Hey, man! - What\\'s up, Tic Tac? Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I... It was a great audition, but it\\'ll never happen again. They tell you what we\\'re up against? Something about some psycho-assassins? We\\'re outside the law on this one. So if you come with us, you\\'re a wanted man. Yeah, well, what else is new? We should get moving. We got a chopper lined up. (MAN SPEAKING GERMAN ON PA) They\\'re evacuating the airport. Stark. Stark? Suit up. IRON MAN: Wow, it\\'s so weird how you run into people at the airport. - Don\\'t you think that\\'s weird? - Definitely weird. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he\\'s behind all of this. Captain. Your Highness. IRON MAN: Anyway... Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out? You\\'re after the wrong guy. Your judgement is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday. And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can\\'t let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can\\'t. BLACK WIDOW: Steve... you know what\\'s about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one? All right, I\\'ve run out of patience. Underoos! - Nice job, kid. - Thanks. I could have stuck the landing a little better, it\\'s just... New suit. It\\'s nothing, Mr Stark. It\\'s perfect. Thank you. Yeah, we don\\'t really need to start a conversation. Okay. Cap. Captain. Big fan. I\\'m Spider-Man. Yeah, we\\'ll talk about it later. - (EXHALES) Hey, everyone. - Good job. You\\'ve been busy. And you\\'ve been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint... \"Rescuing\" Wanda from a place she doesn\\'t even want to leave, a safe place. I\\'m trying to keep... (SIGHS) I\\'m trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart. You did that when you signed. All right, we\\'re done. You\\'re gonna turn Barnes over, you\\'re gonna come with us, now, because it\\'s us... or a squad of J-SOC guys... with no compunction about being impolite. Come on. FALCON: We found it.

All right, there\\'s two on the parking deck. One of them\\'s Maximoff, I\\'m gonna grab her. Rhodey, you wanna take Cap? Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes. Barnes is mine. - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do? What we discussed. Keep your distance, web them up. Okay, copy that. Move, Captain. I won\\'t ask a second time. Look, I really don\\'t want to hurt you. I wouldn\\'t stress about it. (GROANS) (BLACK WIDOW STRAINING) (GROANS) What the hell is that? Everyone\\'s got a gimmick now. (FALCON GROANS) You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude. You have the right to remain silent! Sorry, Cap, this won\\'t kill you... but it ain\\'t gonna tickle either. Wanda, I think you hurt Vision\\'s feelings. You locked me in my room. Okay, first, that\\'s an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. - Hey, Clint. - Hey, man. Clearly, retirement doesn\\'t suit you. You got tired of shooting golf? Well, I played 18, shot 18. Just can\\'t seem to miss. First time for everything. Made you look. FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected. Yeah, I detected that, too. Oh, God! Hey, buddy, I think you lost this! (YELPS) Ahh! Those wings carbon fibre? Is this stuff coming out of you? That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that\\'s awesome, man. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been in a fight before... but there\\'s usually not this much talking. All right, sorry. My bad. Guys, look, I\\'d love to keep this up, but I\\'ve only got one job here today... and I gotta impress Mr Stark, so, I\\'m really sorry. (YELPS) (SCREAMING) You couldn\\'t have done that earlier? I hate you. Great. Hey, Cap, heads-up! Throw it at this. Now! Oh, come on! Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck. Uh, sorry. All right, now I\\'m pissed. Is this part of the plan? Well, my plan was go easy on them. You wanna switch it up? There\\'s our ride. Come on! Captain Rogers... I know you believe what you\\'re doing is right. But for the collective good... you must surrender now. (SPIDER-MAN GRUNTS) FALCON: What do we do, Cap? We fight. This is gonna end well. They\\'re not stopping. Neither are we. (ALL GRUNTING) We\\'re still friends, right? Depends on how hard you hit me. (GROANS) You were pulling your punches. I didn\\'t kill your father. Then why did you run? That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all. Look, kid, there\\'s a lot going on here that you don\\'t understand. Mr Stark said you\\'d say that. Wow. He also said to go for your legs. (BOTH STRAINING) Ahhh! Clint, can you get him off me? Buckled in? ANT-MAN: Yeah. No, I\\'m good. I\\'m good, Arrow Guy. Let\\'s go! (ANT-MAN YELLING) Stark tell you anything else? That you\\'re wrong. You think you\\'re right. That makes you dangerous. Guess he had a point. You got heart, kid. Where you from? Queens. Brooklyn. (STRAINING) (POWERING DOWN) Friday? FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline. What? Oh, you\\'re gonna have to take this into the shop. Who\\'s speaking? It\\'s your conscience. We don\\'t talk a lot these days. Friday? FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system. Uh-oh. Oh, boy! Whoa! (ANT-MAN SCREAMING) We gotta go. That guy\\'s probably in Siberia by now. We gotta draw out the flyers. I\\'ll take Vision, you get to the jet. No, you get to the jet! Both of you! The rest of us aren\\'t getting out of here. As much as I hate to admit it... if we\\'re gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it. FALCON: This isn\\'t the real fight, Steve. All right, Sam. What\\'s the play? We need a diversion. Something big. ANT-MAN: I got something kinda big. But I can\\'t hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half... don\\'t come back for me. He\\'s gonna tear himself in half? You sure about this, Scott? ANT-MAN: I do it all the time. I mean, once. In a lab. Then I passed out. I\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss. (ANT-MAN GRUNTING) Holy shit! (LAUGHING) Okay, tiny dude is big now. He\\'s big now. I guess that\\'s the signal. Way to go, Tic Tac! Give me back my Rhodey. I got him. (GRUNTING) Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they\\'d like to disclose... I\\'m open to suggestions. (GROANS) ANT-MAN: You wanna get to them... you gotta go through me. (GROANS) Uh-huh. (GROANS) We haven\\'t met yet. - I\\'m Clint. - I don\\'t care. (YELLING) Whoa! Ahhh! Get off! Something just flew in me! (SCREAMING) You\\'re not gonna stop. You know I can\\'t. I\\'m gonna regret this. (GROANS) Go. Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?

You\\'re done, all right? What? I\\'m good, I\\'m fine. You did a good job. Stay down. No, it\\'s good. I gotta get him back. You\\'re going home or I\\'ll call Aunt May! - Dude. - You\\'re done! Wait. Mr Stark, wait. (GROANS) I\\'m not done. I\\'m not... (GROANS) Okay, I\\'m done. I\\'m done. BLACK WIDOW: I said I\\'d help you find him, not catch him. There\\'s a difference. (PANTING) I\\'m sorry. Me, too. It\\'s as I said. Catastrophe. Vision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision! You copy? Target his thruster, turn him into a glider. (GROANS) Rhodey! Tony, I\\'m flying dead stick. (GRUNTING) Rhodes! Read vitals. FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way. I\\'m sorry. (WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN ON PHONE) (HELMUT ZEMO SPEAKING GERMAN) - this is room 201... Bacon and black coffee again today? (CHUCKLES) You know me so well... - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - (SPEAKING GERMAN) Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? (GASPS) What\\'s gonna happen to your friends? (SIGHS) Whatever it is... I\\'ll deal with it. I don\\'t know if I\\'m worth all this, Steve. What you did all those years... It wasn\\'t you. You didn\\'t have a choice. I know. But I did it. (WHISPERS) How did this happen? I became distracted. (SCOFFS) I didn\\'t think that was possible. Neither did I. TONY: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration to the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis. NATASHA: Steve\\'s not gonna stop. If you don\\'t either, Rhodey\\'s gonna be the best case scenario. You let them go, Nat. We played this wrong. \"We\"? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA. Are you incapable of letting go of your ego... for one goddamn second? T\\'CHALLA told Ross what you did, so... they\\'re coming for you. I\\'m not the one that needs to watch their back. (WATCH BEEPING) What am I looking at, Friday? FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police. Fire up the chopper. FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man. TONY: Did you run facial recognition yet? FRIDAY: What do I look like? Uh, I don\\'t know. I\\'ve been picturing a redhead. You must be thinking of someone else. Must be. The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo. Sokovian Intelligence. Zemo ran Echo Scorpion... a Sokovian covert kill squad. What happened to the real Broussard? He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis... approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes. Son of a bitch. - Get this to Ross. - Yes, boss. (ICE PICK CHIPPING) (DOOR RUMBLING) (GRUNTS) GUARD: (ON RADIO) This is Raft Prison Control. You\\'re cleared for landing, Mr Stark. So? You got the files? Let\\'s reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy. You seriously think I\\'m gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You\\'re lucky you\\'re not in one of these cells. (CLAPPING) CLINT: The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what\\'s best for you, whether you like it or not. Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they\\'d put you here. Come on. (SPITS) Yeah, well, you knew they\\'d put us somewhere, Tony. Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. This place is for maniacs. This is a place for... CLINT: Criminals? Criminals, Tony. Think that\\'s the word you\\'re looking for. Right? That didn\\'t used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are. - Because you broke the law. - Yeah. I didn\\'t make you. - La, la, la, la, la... - You read it, you broke it. You\\'re all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don\\'t understand, why didn\\'t you think about them before you chose the wrong side? You gotta watch your back with this guy. There\\'s a chance he\\'s gonna break it. Hank Pym always said you never can trust a Stark. Who are you? Come on, man. SAM: How\\'s Rhodes? They\\'re flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow... so fingers crossed. What do you need? They feed you yet? You\\'re the good cop, now? I\\'m just the guy who needs to know where Steve went. Well, you better go get a bad cop... because you\\'re gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass... to get information out of me. Well, I just knocked the A out of their AV. We got about 30 seconds before they realise it\\'s not their equipment. SECRETARY ROSS: What\\'d you do? Get it back up! Just look. Because that... is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong. That\\'s a first. Cap is definitely off the reservation... but he\\'s about to need all the help he can get. We don\\'t know each other very well. You don\\'t have to... Hey, it\\'s all right. (SIGHS) Look, I\\'ll tell you... but you have to go alone and as a friend. Easy. SECRETARY ROSS: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers? Nope. Told me to go to hell. I\\'m going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I\\'ll put you on hold. I like to watch the line blink. You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck? Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs? You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead. What was her name, again? Dolores. You called her Dot. She\\'s gotta be a hundred years old right now. So are we, pal. (WIND HOWLING) STEVE: He can\\'t have been here more than a few hours. BUCKY: Long enough to wake them up. (LOUD THUD) (DOOR CREAKING) You ready? Yeah. You seem a little defensive. It\\'s been a long day. At ease, Soldier. I\\'m not currently after you. Then why are you here? Could be your story\\'s not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I\\'m here. I\\'d like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself. Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. (SCOFFS) It\\'s good to see you, Tony. You too, Cap. Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you\\'re killing me. There\\'s a truce here. You can drop... IRON MAN: I got heat signatures. CAPTAIN AMERICA: How many? Uh, one. HELMUT ZEMO: (ON SPEAKER) If it\\'s any comfort, they died in their sleep. Did you really think I wanted more of you? What the hell? I\\'m grateful to them, though. They brought you here. Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets. IRON MAN: I\\'m betting I could beat that. HELMUT ZEMO: Oh, I\\'m sure you could, Mr Stark. Given time. But then you\\'d never know why you came. You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? I\\'ve thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you\\'re standing here... I just realised... there\\'s a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. (HELMUT ZEMO CHUCKLES) How nice to find a flaw. You\\'re Sokovian. Is that what this is about? Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I\\'m here because I made a promise. You lost someone? (CLICKS TONGUE) I lost everyone. And so will you. An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That\\'s dead. Forever. I know that road. What is this? Help my wife. Please. Help. (GASPS) Sergeant Barnes? MARIA: Howard! Howard! (MARIA GASPING) (WHIMPERS) (CHOKING) No, Tony. Did you know? I didn\\'t know it was him. Don\\'t bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know? Yes. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Get out of here! It wasn\\'t him, Tony. HYDRA had control of his mind! Move! It wasn\\'t him! (BOTH GRUNTING) FRIDAY: Left bootjet failing. Flight systems compromised. Ah, crap. (PANTING) (GROANS) He\\'s not gonna stop. Go. (GROANS) Come on, come on. FRIDAY: Targeting system\\'s knackered, boss. I\\'m eyeballing it. (GASPS) (GROWLS) (WHISPERS) Do you even remember them? I remember all of them. (GROANS) (GROANS) (PANTING) This isn\\'t gonna change what happened. I don\\'t care. He killed my mom. (BOTH GRUNTING) (YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) (IRON MAN GROANS) (YELLING) WOMAN: You should have seen his little face. Just try, okay? I\\'m going to bed. I love you. T\\'CHALLA: I almost killed the wrong man. Hardly an innocent one. T\\'CHALLA: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart. My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, \"Don\\'t worry. \"They\\'re fighting in the city. We\\'re miles from harm.\" When the dust cleared... and the screaming stopped... it took me two days until I found their bodies. My father... still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn\\'t kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other... I\\'m sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son. Vengeance has consumed you. It\\'s consuming them. I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough. Tell that to the dead. (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTS) The living are not done with you, yet. (GRUNTING) FRIDAY: You can\\'t beat him hand-to-hand. Analyze his fight pattern. Scanning. Countermeasures ready. Let\\'s kick his ass. (CAPTAIN AMERICA GROANS) (PANTING) He\\'s my friend. So was I. (COUGHING) Stay down. Final warning. I could do this all day. (GRUNTS) (CAPTAIN AMERICA GRUNTS) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (GASPS) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) That shield doesn\\'t belong to you. You don\\'t deserve it. My father made that shield! (SPITS) Meals at 8 and 5. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line, hmm? So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort... to see it fail so spectacularly? Did it? TONY: It\\'s just the first pass. JAMES RHODES: Yeah. TONY: Give me some feedback, anything you think of. Shock absorption, lateral movement. Cup holder? You may wanna think about some AC down in... - (TONY GASPS) - Ow. Let\\'s go. I\\'ll give you a hand. No. Don\\'t help me. (PANTING) Ah. (CHUCKLES) 138. 138 combat missions. That\\'s how many I\\'ve flown, Tony. Every one of them could\\'ve been my last, but I flew them. Because the fight needed to be fought. It\\'s the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh... This is a bad beat. But it hasn\\'t changed my mind. I don\\'t think. (GRUNTS) - You okay? - Oh, yeah. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) Are you Tony Stank? Yes, this is Tony Stank. You\\'re in the right place. Thank you for that! Never dropping that, by the way. \"Table for one, Mr Stank. - \"Please, by the bathroom.\" - (LAUGHING) STEVE: Tony... I\\'m glad you\\'re back at the compound. I don\\'t like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours. Maybe more so than mine. I\\'ve been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the Army. My faith\\'s in people, I guess. Individuals. And I\\'m happy to say that, for the most part... they haven\\'t let me down. Which is why I can\\'t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn\\'t. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents... I was sparing you... but I can see now that I was really sparing myself. And I\\'m sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords. I really do. I know you\\'re doing what you believe in, and that\\'s all any of us can do. That\\'s all any of us should. FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There\\'s been a breach at the Raft prison. Yeah, put him through. SECRETARY ROSS: Tony, we have a problem. - Uh, please hold. - No, don\\'t. STEVE: So no matter what... I promise you... if you need us... if you need me... I\\'ll be there. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) You sure about this? I can\\'t trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head... I think going back under is the best thing. For everybody. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (AIR HISSING) Thank you for this. Your friend and my father... they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace... You know, if they find out he\\'s here... they\\'ll come for him. Let them try. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, shady baby I\\'m hot like the prodigal son Pick a petal Eenie, meenie, miney, Moe And flower You\\'re the chosen one Well, your left hand\\'s free And your right\\'s in a grip With another left hand Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, no I tackle, we tussle Oh, my days, we\\'re rolling My right hand\\'s gripped on his Colt Single Action Army Oh, no Well, your left hand\\'s free And your right\\'s in a grip With another left hand Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, no N-E-O, O-M-G Gee whiz Girl, you\\'re the one for me Though your man\\'s bigger than I am Oh, my days He disagrees Oh, no Speak easy Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Oh, no Hey, shady baby I\\'m hot like the prodigal son Pick a petal Eenie, meenie, miney, Moe And flower You\\'re the chosen one Well, your left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Oh, no MAY: Who was it? Who hit you? PETER: Some guy. So itchy, man, God. MAY: What\\'s \"some guy\\'s\" name? Uh, Steve. Steve? From 12-C? - With the overbite? - No, no, no. You don\\'t know him. He\\'s from Brooklyn. Ouch. Well... I hope you got a few good licks in. Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. That\\'s way better. Thank you. Okay, tough guy. Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? (CHUCKLES) Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians. Actually, it\\'s native American, but whatever. Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain\\'t bad, is it? No. Yeah. Kid\\'s got a future. Yeah, well, we\\'ll see, I guess. No, hey! Ah! You can\\'t saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use. See? All right. All right. Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon. Yeah. My alarm didn\\'t go off. Yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us. Attention, please! In accordance with executive order 396b, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We\\'ll take it from here. Who the hell are you? Qualified personnel. Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so... I apologize, Mr. toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you\\'ve collected or you will be prosecuted. Ma\\'am, what am...? Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I\\'m all in on this. I could lose my house. I\\'m sorry, sir. There\\'s nothing I can do. Maybe next time, don\\'t overextend yourself. What\\'d you say? Yeah. He\\'s right. I overextended myself. - Hey, hey, hey. - Don\\'t do it. Ah-ah-ah-ah. Put \\'em down. If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors. Your superiors. Who the hell are they? A joint venture between stark industries and the federal government, the department of damage control, will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials. Now the assholes who made this mess are paid to clean it up. Yeah, it\\'s all rigged. Experts estimate there are over 1500 tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area. Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We\\'re supposed to turn this in, right? I ain\\'t hauling it. It\\'s too bad. We could have made some cool stuff from all that alien junk. I tell you what. Let\\'s keep it. The world\\'s changing. It\\'s time we change too. There you go, Mason. Yeah! Business is good. - New York. Queens. - It\\'s a rough borough, - but, hey, it\\'s home. - Who you talking to? No one. Just making a little video of the trip. - You can\\'t show it to anyone. - Yeah, I know. Then why are you narrating in that voice? Uh, because it\\'s fun. Fun. So why do they call you happy? Come on. I\\'m not carrying your bags. Let\\'s go. Hey, should I go to the bathroom before? There\\'s a bathroom on it. Whoa. No pilot? That\\'s awesome. Is that where you\\'re gonna sit? Yeah. This is your first time on a private plane? My first time on any plane. Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise? Shh, shh, shh. No one has actually told me why I\\'m in Berlin or what I\\'m doing. Something about captain America going crazy. - This is you. - Oh, we\\'re neighbors? We\\'re not roommates. Suit up. Okay, Peter, you got this. What the hell are you wearing? It\\'s my suit. Where\\'s the case? What case? What? I thought that was a closet. - This is still my room? - Go. Please. My room is way bigger than... There. - I found the case. - I found the case. \"A minor upgrade\"? Whoa. Oh, my god. Put it on. What the...? This is the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen... Let\\'s go. But I don\\'t understand. Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait. This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. The greatest day of my life. Let\\'s go. Come on. - Okay, there\\'s captain America, - iron man, black widow. - Whoa. Who\\'s that new guy? - Underoos! Oh, that\\'s me. I gotta go. I gotta go. Hey, everyone. Okay, so the craziest thing just happened. I just had a fight with captain America. I stole his shield. I threw it at him... What the hell? He\\'s big now. I gotta go. Hang on. It was the most amazing thing! Mr. stark was like, \"hey, underoos!\" I flipped in and stole cap\\'s shield. I was like, \"what\\'s up, everybody?\" And then... hey, just a second! Coming! Hey. We have thin walls here. What are you doing, a little video diary? - Yeah. - It\\'s all right. - I\\'d do the same thing. - I told him not to. He was filming. I\\'m gonna wipe the chip. Okay. Hey. You know what? We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready? An alibi? Sure. Okay. We rolling? Get in the frame. Hey, may. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope. Peter, that\\'s inappropriate. Let\\'s start over. You can edit it. Three, two, one. Hey, may. My gosh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed. - Come on! - It\\'s a freaking merge. Sorry. Because you\\'re not on queens boulevard. See, happy is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver. That was a private conversation. I don\\'t like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that. No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch? - Here we are. End of the line. - Whoops. Can you give us a moment? Want me to leave the car? Grab Peter\\'s case out of the trunk. I can keep the suit? Yes, we were just talking about it. Do me a favor, though. Happy\\'s kind of your point guy on this. Don\\'t stress him out. Don\\'t do anything stupid. I\\'ve seen his cardiogram. All right? Yes. Don\\'t do anything I would do, and don\\'t do anything i wouldn\\'t do. There\\'s a little gray area in there. Where you operate. Wait, does that mean I\\'m an avenger? No. - This it? - Seventh floor. I can take that. You don\\'t have to. You\\'ll take it? Yeah, I can take that. Thank you. So when\\'s our next...? When\\'s our next \"retreat,\" you know? What, next mission? Yeah, the mission. The missions. We\\'ll call you. Do you have my numbers? No, I mean, we\\'ll call you. Like, someone will call you. All right? From your team. Okay. All right. That\\'s not a hug. I\\'m just grabbing the door for you. We\\'re not there yet. Bye. They\\'re gonna call me. What\\'s up, penis Parker? Rise and shine, midtown science and technology. Students, don\\'t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming? Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date. Okay. Yeah. Damn it. You, in my office right now. Join me, and together we\\'ll build my new lego death star. - What? - So lame. No way. That\\'s awesome. How many pieces? Three thousand eight hundred and three. That\\'s insane. I know. You want to build it tonight? No, I can\\'t tonight. I\\'ve got the stark... Mm-hm. Stark internship. Yeah, exactly. Always got that internship. Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it\\'ll lead to a real job with them. That would be so sweet. Right? He\\'d be all, \"good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\\'s a gold coin.\" I don\\'t know how jobs work. That\\'s exactly how they work. I\\'ll knock out the basic bones of the death star at my place. I\\'ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops. That\\'d be great. I\\'m gonna be late! Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points a and b? Flash. It\\'s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass. Nope. Peter. You still with us? Uh, uh, yeah, yeah. Uh... Mass cancels out, so it\\'s just gravity times sine. Right. See, flash, being the fastest isn\\'t always the best if you are wrong. You\\'re dead. Today we\\'re talking about Danish physicist niels bohr, but trust me, there\\'s nothing bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory. - Did Liz get a new top? - No. We\\'ve seen that before, but never with that skirt. - Liz, hey. That looks so good. - Hi! We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy. Too late. You guys are losers. Well, then why do you sit with us? Because I don\\'t have any friends. Let\\'s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element? Hydrogen\\'s the lightest. That\\'s not the question. Okay. Yeah. Uranium. That is correct. Thank you, Abraham. Yes. Open your books to page 10. Peter, it\\'s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off? I can\\'t go to Washington. If Mr. stark needs me, I have to make sure I\\'m here. You\\'ve never been in the same room as Tony stark. Wait. What\\'s happening? Peter\\'s not going to Washington. No. No, no, no. Why not? Really? Right before nationals? He already quit marching band and robotics lab. I\\'m not obsessed with him. Just very observant. Flash, you\\'re in for Peter. - I don\\'t know. - I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with black widow coming up. That is false. What\\'d I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes? Hey, what\\'s up? Hey, man. What\\'s up, Mr. delmar? Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right? Yeah, and with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks. You got it, boss. How\\'s your aunt? Yeah, she\\'s all right. Ten dollars. It\\'s $5. For that comment, $10. Hey, come on. I\\'m joking. I\\'m joking. Here\\'s $5. What\\'s up, murph? How you doing, buddy? So how\\'s school? Ah, you know. It\\'s boring. Got better things to do. Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you\\'re gonna end up like me. This is great. Best sandwiches in queens. Finally. - Excuse me. - What\\'s the matter with you? Could you hold this for a second? Thanks. Hey, is this anybody\\'s bike? No? - Hey, buddy, is this your bike? - I have no change. Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen? Everybody good? Hey! You\\'re that spider guy on YouTube, right? Call me spider-man! Okay, spider-man. Do a flip. Yeah! Not bad. Hey, buddy. Shouldn\\'t steal cars, it\\'s bad. It\\'s my car, dumbass! Hey! Shut that off! Can you tell him it\\'s my car? I was just... Yo! I work at nights. Come on. That\\'s not your car! That\\'s his car. How was I supposed to know? He put that in the window! Every day with these alarms! Turn it off! Don\\'t make me come down there. Hey, Gary! How you doing? Marjorie, how are you? How\\'s your mother? I\\'m good, I\\'m good. You have reached the voicemail box of: Happy hogan. - Hey, happy. - Here\\'s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn\\'t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. I just feel like i could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission\\'s gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It\\'s Peter. Parker. Why would I tell him about the churro? Oh. Unh. Hey, hey. Oh! Ah. Okay. Can\\'t wait to see this thing. Finally, something good. Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy. - Told you it was worth it. - Okay, go, go, go. Oh, heh, nice. We can hit, like, five more places tonight. Ahem. What\\'s up, guys? You forget your pin number? Whoa! You\\'re the avengers. What are you guys doing here? Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you\\'d be more handsome in person. Iron man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You\\'re a billionaire. Hey... Oh, this feels so weird. What is that thing? I\\'m starting... To think... You\\'re not... The avengers. 911. What\\'s your emergency? Uh, spider-man is fighting the avengers in a bank on 21st street. - All right, let\\'s wrap this up. - It\\'s a school night. So how do jerks like you get tech like this? No. Wait, wait, wait! Ah! Mr. delmar. Hey, Mr. delmar, you in here? Is anybody in here? Hello? Oh, come on. I gotta... Here, here. Good, yeah. Okay. Good. Yes. Yes... no. No, put that down. That\\'s worth more than you or me. Yeah? Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an atm with high-tech weapons... Take a breath. I don\\'t have time for atm robberies yeah, but... Or the notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything\\'s gotta be out by next week. Wait, wait. You\\'re moving? Who\\'s moving? Yeah, don\\'t you watch the news? Tony sold avengers tower. We\\'re relocating to a new facility upstate where hopefully the cell service is much worse. But what about me? What about you? Well, what if Mr. stark needs me or something big goes down? Can I just please talk to Mr. stark? Stay away from anything dangerous. I\\'m responsible for making sure you\\'re responsible, okay? I am responsible. I... oh, crap. My backpack\\'s gone. That doesn\\'t sound responsible. I\\'ll call you back. Feel free not to. What was that? Uh, it\\'s nothing. Nothing. You\\'re the spider-man. From YouTube. I\\'m not. I\\'m not. You were on the ceiling. What are you doing in my room? May let me in. We were gonna finish the death star. You can\\'t just bust into my room! That Turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\\'s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want thai? Yes. No. He\\'s got a thing. A thing to do after. Okay. Maybe put on some clothes. Oh, she doesn\\'t know? Nobody knows. Mr. stark knows because he made my suit. That\\'s it. Tony stark made you that? Are you an avenger? Yeah, basically. Oh, geez. You can\\'t tell anybody. You gotta keep it a secret. Secret? Why? You know what she\\'s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every night, she won\\'t let me do this. Come on, ned, please. Okay, okay, okay. I\\'ll level with you. I can\\'t keep this a secret. It\\'s the greatest thing that\\'s ever happened to me. Ned, may cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now. You know? I mean, everything that\\'s happened with her, i... please. Okay. Just swear it, okay? I swear. Thank you. Yeah. I can\\'t believe this is happening now. Can I try the suit on? No. How\\'s it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings? I\\'m gonna tell you tomorrow. Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the stark internship? This is the stark internship. Ohh... Just get out of here. What\\'s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It\\'s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say \"larb\" before... You talk to me? You know I larb you. I\\'m just stressed. The internship, and I\\'m tired. A lot of work. The stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony stark. You\\'re distracted all the time. He\\'s got you in your head. Delmar\\'s sandwiches destroyed... What does he have you doing? You need to use your instincts. After an atm robbery was thwarted by queens\\' own crime stopper, what? The spider-man. As the spider-man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed. If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Six blocks away from us. I need a new backpack. What? I need a new backpack. That\\'s five. Sticky rice pudding. We didn\\'t order that. It\\'s on the house. Oh. Thanks. That\\'s nice of him. I think he larbs you. You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would\\'ve hurt, right? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I\\'d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt? The spider\\'s dead, ned. Whoa. You were here? Yeah. You could\\'ve died. Do you lay eggs? What? No. Can you spit venom? No. Can you summon an army of spiders? No, ned. The sokovia accords were put into place... How far can you shoot your webs? It\\'s unknown. Shut up. To begin regulating... If I was you, i would stand on a building and shoot as far as I could... Shut up, ned. Hi. I\\'m captain America. Whether you\\'re in the classroom or on the battlefield... Do you know him too? Yeah, we met. I stole his shield. What? Today, my good friend, your gym teacher will be conducting the captain America fitness challenge. Thank you, captain. Pretty sure he\\'s a war criminal, but I have to show these videos. It\\'s required by the state. Let\\'s do it. Do avengers have to pay taxes? What does hulk smell like? - I bet he smells nice. - You have to shut up. Is captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa? Ned, just shh, okay? Hey, can I be your guy in the chair? What? Yeah. You know how there\\'s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go? If you\\'re in a burning building, i could tell you where to go. There\\'d be screens around me, and I could swivel around. I could be your guy in the chair. Ned, I don\\'t need a guy in the chair. Looking good, Parker. Now, see, for me, it would be f Thor marry iron man and kill hulk. Well, what about the spider-man? It\\'s just spider-man. See the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys. Oh, my god, she\\'s crushing on spider-man. No way. Kind of. Oh, gross. He\\'s probably, like, 30. You don\\'t know what he looks like. What if he\\'s seriously burned? I wouldn\\'t care. I\\'d love him for the person he is inside. Peter knows spider-man. No, I don\\'t. No. I... I mean... They\\'re friends. Yeah, like coach Wilson and captain America are friends. I\\'ve met him, yeah. A couple times. But it\\'s... Through the stark internship. Yeah, well, I\\'m not really supposed to talk about it. Well, that\\'s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz\\'s party. Right? Yeah, um, I\\'m having people over tonight. You\\'re more than welcome to come. - Having a party? - Yeah, it\\'s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend spider-man. Um... It\\'s okay. I know Peter\\'s way too busy for parties anyway, so... Come on. He\\'ll be there. Right, Parker? What are you doing? Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you. Dude, you\\'re an avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it\\'s you. House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous. It\\'ll be a night to remember. Oh... Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat. Yeah, it gives me confidence. Hm. This is a mistake. Hey, let\\'s just go home. Oh, Peter. I know. I know it\\'s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body\\'s going through. It\\'s flowering now. He\\'s so stressed out lately. What helps with stress is a party. We should go to the party. Yeah, let\\'s do it. I\\'m gonna go. Peter... Have fun, okay? Okay. I will. Bye, may. Dude, you have the suit, right? Yeah. This is gonna change our lives. Annie, over here! Hey. Hey. Dj flash. Okay. We\\'re gonna have spider-man swing in, say you guys are tight, and I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs. Can\\'t believe you\\'re at this lame party. But you\\'re here too. Am I? Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys. Cool hat, ned. Hi, Liz. Hi, Liz. I\\'m so happy you guys came. There\\'s pizza and drinks. Help yourself. What a great party. Thanks. Oh, i... My parents will kill me if anything\\'s broken. I gotta... Yeah. Have fun. - Bye. - Bye. Dude, what are you doing? She\\'s here. Spider it up. No, no, no. I can\\'t... I cannot do this. Spider-man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I\\'m just gonna be myself. Peter, no one wants that. Dude. Penis Parker, what\\'s up? So where\\'s your pal spider-man? Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend? That\\'s not spider-man. That\\'s just ned in a red shirt. \"Hey, what\\'s up? I\\'m spider-man. \"Just thought I\\'d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. \"Oh, what\\'s up, ned? Hey, where\\'s Peter, anyways? He must be around...\" God, this is stupid. What am I doing? What the hell? Whoo! This sucks. Whoo! Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-ultron arm straight from sokovia. Here. You try. Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man? Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec. Okay, I got black hole grenades, chitauri railguns... You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We\\'re the only ones selling these high-tech weapons. Oh, this must be where the atm robbers got their stuff. I need something to stick up somebody. I\\'m not trying to shoot them back in time. I got antigrav climbers. Yo, climbers? Okay, what the hell is that? Did you set us up? Hey, hey, man. Hey! Come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me. All right. What was that? What...? We gotta call him. No, no, no, no. Did you just do it again? Shut up. I\\'m calling him. Toomes\\'s phone. Boss. Oh, my butt! Great. Guess I\\'m gonna have to take a shortcut. Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun. Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch. Whoo! Now, this is more like it. Whoa! Smells really good. Great movie! Oh, hey, guys. No! No! - Hey, it\\'s Peter. - Leave a message. Peter, where are you? The hat\\'s not working. This is not cool. Almost got you. Thought you got away from me, didn\\'t you? I got you right where I want you. Surprise! What the hell? Oh, hey. And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster and picked me up, and took me up like a thousand feet and just dropped me. How\\'d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit? I put everything in your suit. Including this heater. Whoa. That\\'s better. Thanks. What were you thinking? The guy with wings is the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down. Take him down now, huh? Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing. The avengers? No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade. Mr. stark, you didn\\'t have to come out here. I had that. I was fine. Oh, I\\'m not here. Thank god this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you\\'re at it. Cheers. Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please. Why? Why? Because I said so! Sorry, I\\'m talking to a teenager. Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping the little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can\\'t you just be a friendly neighborhood spider-man? But I\\'m ready for more than that now. No, you\\'re not. That is not what you thought when I took on captain America. Trust me, kid. If cap wanted to lay you out, he would\\'ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call happy. Are you driving? You know, it\\'s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at mit. End call. No, I don\\'t need to go to... Mr. stark is no longer connected. That\\'s awesome. \"Stay close to the ground\"? What is he talking about? Whoa. Hey, man, what\\'s up? I\\'m on my way back. Actually, i was calling to say maybe you shouldn\\'t come. Listen to this. When I say \"penis,\" you say \"Parker.\" - Penis! - Parker! - Penis! - Parker! - Sorry, Peter. - I guess we\\'re still losers. I\\'ll see you tomorrow. I\\'ll see you tomorrow in school. Whoa. Idiots. Idiots. Idiots! Boss? Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light. What\\'d I tell you about looking at my phone? Oh. Sorry. You left it out. You know I\\'m a curious person by nature. I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal. Huh? In case you want to, you know, go for the big one? You\\'re still on that? I told you, no. The answer\\'s no. Forget it. Ha, ha, ha! Whoo! I mean, that was badass. How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open? You said, move the merchandise. Under the radar. Under the radar! That\\'s how we survive. If you bring damage control or the avengers down here, we\\'re through. You\\'re out there wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars calling yourself the shocker. \"I\\'m the shocker. I shock people.\" What is this, pro wrestling? Whatever, old man. Come on. Look. Look. I know you don\\'t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people i have to look after. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? I can\\'t afford your bullshit. Get out of here. What? You\\'re done. You\\'re off the crew. Yeah, all right. Heh. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know. Excuse me? I\\'m just saying, maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from. You know what? What? You\\'re right. That work? I don\\'t know. I can\\'t afford that. W-w-wait. Damn. I thought this was the antigravity gun. What? No, that\\'s that one. Here. Now you\\'re the shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost. All right. Hey, thanks for bailing on me. Yeah, well, something came up. Oh, what is that? I don\\'t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it. Seriously? Yeah. Awesome. I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary. Yeah. Well, look, I think it\\'s a power source. Yeah, but it\\'s connected to all these microprocessors. That\\'s an inductive charging plate. That\\'s what I use to charge my toothbrush. Whoever\\'s making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours. That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing... Keep your fingers clear of the blades. I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it. We\\'ll go to the lab after class and run some tests. Let\\'s do it. First, we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer. We gotta come up with a better name than \"glowy thingy.\" You\\'re right. Crap. Come on, come on, come on. High schools creep me out. They got this funny smell, you know what I mean? Hey, that\\'s one of the guys that tried to kill me. What? Yeah. We gotta get out of here. No, no, no. I gotta follow them. They can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake. Someone dropped you in a lake? Yeah, it was not good. Peter... No. Stay there, ned. Peter. What are you doing? Nothing. Yeah. You good? Chess. Man, can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were? It\\'s saying there was an energy pulse here. There\\'s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it\\'s gone. So are we. This is so awesome. I know, right? They\\'re in Brooklyn. Staten island. Leaving Jersey. They stopped. Huh. Maryland? What\\'s there? I don\\'t know. Evil lair? They have a lair? Dude, a gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair. Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it\\'s, like, 300 miles away? It\\'s not too far from D.C. Hey, it\\'s Peter. Guys. - Peter? - Hey, buddy. Yeah, I was hoping I could rejoin the team. No, no way. You can\\'t quit on us, stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone. Hey, welcome back, Peter! Flash, you\\'re back to first alternate. What? He\\'s taking your place. Excuse me, can we go already? I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner. Protesting is patriotic. Let\\'s get on the bus. Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of saturn. Second law of thermodynamics. Frank Sinatra. Fort sumter. Flash is wrong. Okay, guys, let\\'s focus. Next one. Liz, don\\'t overwork \\'em. Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium. Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back. Glad to be back. What is the current standard unit of...? Can I take this real quick? I\\'ll only be a sec. Yeah, fine. Hello? Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York? Okay, focus up, everyone. Tracker. Yeah, it\\'s just a school trip. It\\'s nothing. Look, happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without permission is a complete violation of my privacy. That\\'s different. What\\'s different? Nothing. Look, it\\'s just the academic decathlon. It\\'s no big deal. Hey, hey. I\\'ll decide if it\\'s no big deal. Sounds like it\\'s no big deal, but remember, I\\'m watching you. Everyone stick together. Yeah. You kidding me? This place is huge. I\\'ve seen bigger. There\\'s a bird in here. Hey, you brought your laptop, right? Why? Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit? Uh, because i gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don\\'t really want Mr. stark to know about it. So you\\'re lying to iron man now? No, I\\'m not lying. He just doesn\\'t really get what I can do yet. Oh, gotcha. All right, happy, enjoy tracking this lamp. There\\'s a ton of other subsystems in here. Hm? But they\\'re all disabled by the training wheels protocol. What? \"Training wheels protocol\"? Turn it off. I don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea. They\\'re blocked for a reason. Come on, man, i don\\'t need training wheels. I\\'m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It\\'s not cool. But you are a kid. Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands. Peter, I just don\\'t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal? Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on. I really don\\'t think this is a good idea. The guy in the chair. Don\\'t do that. Come on. The glowy thing, it\\'s evidence. Keep it safe, all right? Okay. Okay. They\\'re moving. Be careful. Hey, Liz. Perfect timing. We\\'re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on. What? Hey, Peter. Hi. Hey. I was... I was gonna go study in the business center. Peter, you don\\'t need to study. You\\'re, like, the smartest guy I\\'ve ever met. And besides, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale. Hm? Well, I read that in a Ted talk, so... I... I heard it in a Ted talk. And I read a coaching book. Are you really... This is really important to you. Yeah. It\\'s our future. I\\'m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, $11. So get your trunks on and come on. Come on. Come on. I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming. Let\\'s go. Good evening, Peter. Hello? Hello? Congratulations on completing the rigorous training wheels protocol and gaining access to your suit\\'s full capabilities. Ah, thank you. So, where would you like to take me tonight? I put a tracker on someone. He\\'s a bad guy. Tracker located. Plotting course to intercept target. Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for decathlon, it\\'s fine. One hundred meters from destination and closing. Jump now. Detecting three individuals. Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That\\'s so lame. Hey, suit lady, what are they doing? Do you want to hear what they\\'re saying? I can hear what they\\'re saying? Uh, yeah. Activating enhanced reconnaissance mode. I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is my design. Whoa, that\\'s so cool. Can\\'t believe they\\'re still cleaning the triskelion mess. - I love it. - They keep making messes, - we keep getting rich. - Target inbound. Whoa, they\\'re in the middle of a heist. I could catch \\'em all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I\\'m gonna get a little closer so I can see what\\'s happening. Would you like me to engage enhanced combat mode? \"Enhanced combat mode\"? Yeah. Activating instant kill. No, no, no, no. I don\\'t want to kill anybody. Deactivating instant kill. Did you hear that? What the hell just happened? What was that? You jumped off the sign and landed on your face. Suit lady, what\\'s wrong with my web-shooters? Rapid-fire is the default for enhanced combat mode. Why would I need rapid-fire? Would you like to see more options? You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations. Mr. stark really overdid it. You two wait right here. Wait. You\\'re gonna want to turn on the dampers or that thing will shatter your arm. All right, where\\'s the dampers? That one. Great choice. Would you like me to set this as your new default? No, no, no. Push that in. Right here? No, the other... This one here? Yeah, push it. What was that? Taser webs. Taser webs? I don\\'t want taser webs. You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course? No. Just... you choose. Sure thing. Six-Alpha-niner, are you running on time? Copy, central. Six-Alpha-niner on schedule. I got a visual. Green light, green light. Oh, that\\'s him. Okay. I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose. Deploy anchors. Dropping down. No outgoing distress signals. You\\'re all clear. Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here. Whoa, cool. It\\'s like some kind of matter phase shifter. All right, coming up. Hey, big bird! This doesn\\'t belong to you. Oh, god. Suit lady, what was that? You told me to choose. What? No, just set everything back to normal. Activating all systems. Oh, my head. You appear to have a mild concussion. Hey, so where am i right now? I\\'m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors. Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady, we\\'re gonna have to fight our way out of this one. Three, two, one! What is this place? Suit lady, where am I? You\\'re in the most secure facility on the eastern seaboard. The damage control deep storage vault. No. Seriously? The door will most likely remain closed until morning. Morning? Hey, suit lady, i kind of feel bad calling you \"suit lady,\" you know? I think I should probably give you a name... Like Liz. No, no, no. God, that\\'s... That\\'s weird. What about Karen? You can call me Karen if you would like. Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do? What? Maybe we should run that refresher course. Ricochet web. Ricochet web. Whoa! Cool. Splitter web. Web grenade. Web grenade! Should I tell Liz that I\\'m spider-man? Who is Liz? Who\\'s Liz? She\\'s... heh. She\\'s the best. She\\'s awesome. She\\'s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it\\'s kind of weird, you know? \"Hey, I\\'m... I\\'m spider-man.\" What\\'s weird about that? What if she\\'s expecting someone like Tony stark? Imagine how disappointed she\\'d be when she sees me. Well, if I were her, I wouldn\\'t be disappointed at all. Thanks, Karen. It\\'s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways? Thirty-seven minutes. What? Thirty-seven minutes? That\\'s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I got to... I gotta get out of here. There\\'s got to be something in here I can use. Okay, let\\'s see. Nope. That\\'s awesome. Ah. Hey, it\\'s like the glowy thing. That glowy thing is an explosive chitauri energy core. Whoa, whoa! You mean, we\\'ve been carrying around a bomb? It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state. No, no, no, no, no. Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock. Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it. Trial unsuccessful. Okay, we\\'re just gonna have to try every sequence. Ned, Peter, we\\'re gonna be late. Come on, let\\'s go. Okay. Hold on, hold on. Initiating trial 247. It worked. It works! Please be sure all cell phones are turned off. Thank you. Karen, get me to the decathlon as fast as possible. Sure thing. Just tell me where it is. Across from the Washington monument. It\\'s ned. Leave a message. Ned, call me back! The glowy thing\\'s a bomb! There\\'s a vehicle approaching on your right. We have now entered sudden death. The next correct answer wins the championship. Midtown tech? Zero. That is correct. Midtown takes the championship! Whoo-hoo! - We won! You guys, i am so proud of you. Told you we didn\\'t need Peter. Flash, you didn\\'t answer one question. Taking it all in? Oh, yeah, I just... Um, I don\\'t want to celebrate something that was built by slaves. I\\'m sure the Washington monument wasn\\'t built by... Okay. Enjoy your book. Thanks. Oh, ned, you\\'re alive! Peter, are you okay? Where\\'s the glowy thing? The glowy thing? Don\\'t worry, it\\'s safe. It\\'s in my backpack. Ned, listen! The glowy thing is dangerous! You missed the decathlon. I covered for you. Ned, listen to me! We\\'re at the Washington mon... Peter, is that you? Hey, Liz. Is that Liz? Put ned on the phone. Tell her how you feel. You flake! You are so lucky we won. I want to be mad, but I\\'m more worried. Like, what is going on with you? I have to talk to ned. It\\'s important! Miss, all items on the belt, please. There\\'s something in ned\\'s backpack! It\\'s dangerous. Don\\'t let it go through an X-ray. Liz? Liz! Damn it. Mr. Harrison, can I be the one to tell Peter he\\'s expelled? The Washington monument is 555 feet, five and one-eighth inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone. Did you hear that? No, no, no. Karen, what\\'s going on up there? The chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator. Oh, no. My friends are up there. What? Don\\'t worry, ma\\'am, everything\\'s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that\\'s tall. Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling. Just stay calm, everyone. Oh, we are all going to die here. Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure. We\\'re freakin\\' screwed. Okay, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working. The safety systems are completely failing. We\\'re very safe in here. The occupants are in imminent mortal danger. I\\'m going as fast as I can! Let\\'s go. Give me your hand. You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure. What? Why? Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate. How do I get in there? Activating reconnaissance drone. Whoa. Has that been there this whole time? That\\'s awesome. Locating optimal entry point. Proceed to southwest window. Karen, I\\'m on my way. There\\'s a lot of glass here. You got this. Keep coming, keep coming. Ah! Okay. Oh, my god. Okay. What\\'s wrong? You\\'ve reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating? It\\'s fine. I\\'ve just never been this high before. You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal. Perfect. Oh, my god. Why is it not breaking? It\\'s four-inch ballistic glass. You\\'ll have to create more momentum. This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself. My friends are in there! Stop! Return to the ground immediately. Okay, who\\'s next? Me, it\\'s my turn! - Flash, seriously? - What are you doing? Come on. Don\\'t worry about the trophy. Ahh! Stand down! Return to the ground immediately! Return to the ground or we will open fire! Go up, go up. I got this. Take my trophy! This is your last chance! Oh, I\\'m gonna die. Look out! Ahh! I did it! Whoa! Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don\\'t worry about it. I got you. Yes! Yes! Hey, hey, hey. Big guy, quit moving around. I\\'m sorry, sir. So sorry. Let\\'s go, let\\'s go! Okay, okay. Mr. harrington, go. Ned, come on. This is your stop. Come on, Liz. Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it! - Are you sure it\\'s safe? - Liz! You\\'re okay. You\\'re okay. Okay. Oh, my god. Good, good. Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. You guys good? So is everyone okay? This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her. Oh! Thank you. Are you really friends with Peter Parker? I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck... Yeah, damn it. We still have enough to do the gargan deal though, right? Yeah, but then that\\'s it. Oh, maybe it is time that i built the high-altitude seal. Would you shut up about that? It\\'s only one job. No. Eight years, not a word from the feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I\\'ve built. Really? I\\'m gonna kill him. I\\'m gonna find him... I found him. Spider-man swooped in, heroically saving an academic decathlon team from queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown. Mom. Okay. All right. Peter? Come here, come here. Oh, my god. This past weekend, midtown\\'s academic decathlon team defeated the country\\'s best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death. Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. All scream. There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere. It was tight, like a bon jovi concert. As you know, we made it out alive, and that\\'s the important thing. I couldn\\'t bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the spider-man. Thank you, spider-man. Thank you, spider-man. Up next: The spider-man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit? Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it\\'s you? Crazy, dude. It\\'s crazy. Should we tell everyone? No. Should I tell everyone? No, dude. That\\'s not a good idea. Okay, come on, we\\'ll be late to class. I\\'m not going to class. You\\'re already in trouble for ditching the decathlon. Dude, listen, I figured it out. The wingsuit guy is stealing from damage control. What he takes from damage control, that\\'s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him. But we have a Spanish quiz. Ned, I\\'m probably never gonna come back here. Mr. stark is moving the avengers upstate so when I bring this guy in... Dude. You want to be a high school dropout? I am so far beyond high school right now. Parker, my office. So... You got detention. You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who\\'s been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules. We all know what\\'s right. We all know what\\'s wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong... Where you going? Get back here. Just think to yourself, what would captain America do? Why are you here? You don\\'t even have detention. Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis. Heh. It\\'s you. So your body\\'s changing. Believe me, I know how that feels. May? Hey, Karen. What\\'s up? - Hey, Peter. - How was your Spanish quiz? I was wondering if you could help me. I\\'m trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I can only remember part of a license plate. I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter. Footage? Yes, Peter. I record everything you see. Everything? Like, all the time? Everything. It\\'s called the baby-monitor protocol. Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday. With pleasure. Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. What\\'s up, Liz? Peter\\'s told me a lot about you. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day. It is I, Thor, son of Odin! No, no, no. That\\'s definitely... That\\'s not what we wanted to watch. Your impressions are very funny. Fast-forward to the arms deal. Okay. The two on the right, who are they? Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals. Nothing? One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in queens. Let\\'s pay him a visit. Would you like me to activate the enhanced interrogation protocol? Uh, yeah. Remember me? Hey... I need information. You\\'ll give it to me now. All right, chill. Come on! What happened to your voice? What do you mean? I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like. I\\'m not a girl! I\\'m a boy. I mean, I\\'m a... I\\'m a man. I don\\'t care what you are, a boy, a girl... I\\'m not a girl! I\\'m a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else. You ain\\'t ever done this before, huh? Deactivate interrogation mode. Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can\\'t be out on the streets. If one of them can cut delmar\\'s bodega in half... You know delmar\\'s? Yeah, best sandwich in queens. Sub haven\\'s pretty good. It\\'s too much bread. I like bread. Come on, man, please. Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don\\'t ever do that again. The other night, you told that dude, \"if you shoot somebody, shoot me.\" It\\'s pretty ballsy. I don\\'t want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here. Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings? Other than he\\'s a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don\\'t know who he is or where he is. I do know where he\\'s gonna be. Really? Yeah, this crazy dude i used to work with, he\\'s supposed to be doing a deal with him. Yes! Heh. Yes. Thank... Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn\\'t tell you where. You don\\'t have a location. Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just... Yeah. Where is it? Can I give you some advice? Hm? You got to get better at this part of the job. I don\\'t understand. I\\'m intimidating. Staten island ferry, 11. Oh, that\\'s soon. Hey, that\\'s gonna dissolve in two hours. No, no, no, no. Come fix this. Two hours. You deserve that. I got ice cream in here. You deserve that. You\\'re a criminal. Bye, Mr. criminal. Nice. Okay, Karen, activate enhanced reconnaissance mode. Sure thing. He\\'s up front, main deck. I hate this guy. It\\'s the guy from the bridge, right? Who\\'s that other guy? Just keep me posted. There\\'s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from may Parker. Should I reroute to your heads-up display? I can\\'t talk right now. I\\'ll call her back. Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can\\'t let anybody get away this time. - Who\\'s the guy on the left? - Mac gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate instant kill? No, Karen, stop it with the instant kill already. White pickup truck. Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck. Oh, this is too perfect. They got the weapons, buyers and sellers in one place. Incoming call from Tony stark. No, no, no. Don\\'t answer. Mr. Parker. Got a sec? - Uh, I\\'m actually at school. - No, you\\'re not. Nice work in D.C. okay. My dad never really gave me a lot of support and I\\'m trying to break the cycle of shame. I\\'m kind of in the middle of something. Don\\'t cut me off when I\\'m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to... what is that? I\\'m at band practice. That\\'s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What\\'s up? I gotta go! End call. Hey. I\\'ll take those! Yoink! Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30. You missed it! Whoo! Spider guy\\'s here. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast. Ah! Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard. I got to say, the other guy was way better with that thing. I\\'m honestly... I\\'m... I\\'m shocked. Freeze! FBI! Don\\'t move! Get on the ground! FBI! What do you mean, FBI? The federal bureau of invest... I know what \"FBI\" means. But what are they doing here? What the...? Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Go, go, go, go! Get out of there! Whoa! Look out! Look out! Move! Move! Move! - Move! - Get to the top deck. We\\'re getting out of here. Ah! Ah! Activate taser web! You\\'re messing with things you don\\'t understand. Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points. Web grenade. Web grenade. Splitter web, go. - Great job, Peter. - You are 98 percent successful. Ninety-eight? Yeah, spider-man! No, no, no. No! No! Oh, my god! No! Ah! What the hell? What the hell? Hi, spider-man. Band practice, was it? Look! Look! Yeah, iron man! Uh, Mr. stark. Hey, Mr. stark, could I do anything? What do you want me to do? Whoa! I think you\\'ve done enough. - So that\\'s it? - You\\'re just gonna run? Feds were waiting for us. Now we\\'re on iron man\\'s radar? Yeah, I\\'m running. You should too. You know i can\\'t do that. So now what? Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time? Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this. You in? Previously on Peter screws the pooch, I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do. Is everyone okay? No thanks to you. No thanks to me? Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it, but you didn\\'t listen. None of this would\\'ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you\\'d actually be here. I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid. I\\'m 15. No. This is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? \\'Cause that\\'s on you. And if you died, I feel like that\\'s on me. I don\\'t need that on my conscience. Yes, sir, I\\'m sorry. Yes. I understand. Sorry doesn\\'t cut it. I just wanted to be like you. And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it\\'s not working out. I\\'m gonna need the suit back. For how long? Forever. Yeah, that\\'s how it works. No, no. Please. Please. Let\\'s have it. You don\\'t understand. This is all I have. I\\'m nothing without this suit. If you\\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\\'t have it, okay? God, I sound like my dad. I don\\'t have any other clothes. Okay, we\\'ll sort that out. Hey. I\\'ve been calling you all day. You didn\\'t answer your phone. You can\\'t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I\\'ve called five police stations. Five. I called five of your friends. I called ned\\'s mother. I\\'m fine. May, I\\'m okay. Honestly, just relax. I\\'m fine. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That\\'s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what\\'s going on. Just lay it out. It\\'s just me and you. I lost the stark internship. What? Yeah. What happened? I just thought that i could work really hard and he could... He would... you know. But... I screwed it up. Oh, it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. I\\'m sorry i made you worry. You know I\\'m not trying to ruin your life. Yeah, I know. Just... I used to sneak out too. Yeah. And take a shower. You smell. You smell like... You smell like garbage. I know. Peter, you\\'re a good kid and you\\'re a smart kid, so just try to keep your head straight, okay? Okay. All right, get out of here. Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that school on 46th where their principal has a crossbow? Pretty sure that\\'s an urban myth, and, no, I\\'m not expelled. You\\'re so lucky. Muy bueno, se�or Parker. Hey. Hey. I thought you had calculus fifth period. Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff. Hey, look, i... I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing. It\\'s fine. Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but then i almost died. No, I just... I\\'m... I just mean that it was not cool, especially... Because... I like you. I know. You do? You\\'re terrible at keeping secrets. Yeah, you\\'d be surprised. I got to get to class, but... I\\'d say we should hang out, but I\\'m gonna be in detention for... Uh-huh. Ever, but... I guess you already have a date to homecoming. Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so... Uh, you want to go with me? Yeah. Sure. Really? I mean, great. Cool. Cool. I\\'m actually going that way. May, I need your help. Right? - It\\'s game day. - So what\\'s the plan? Open the door for her. Mm-hm. Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that\\'s creepy. Don\\'t be creepy. No. And when I dance with her, I\\'m putting my hands on her hips. I got this. - Love you. - Bye. You must be Peter. Yeah. I\\'m Liz\\'s dad. Put \\'er there. Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on. Hi, Peter. You look very handsome. Thank you. You got his name right? Freddie? Peter. Peter. Peter. I\\'m gonna go get Liz. Okay. You all right, Pete? Yeah. Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that? I\\'m not old enough to drink. That\\'s the right answer. Wow! Wow, wow, wow, do you look beautiful. Please don\\'t embarrass me, dad. Doesn\\'t she, Pete? Yeah, you look really good. Once again, that\\'s the right answer. Is that a corsage? Thanks. Well, hey, I\\'m your chauffeur, so let\\'s get this show on the road. No, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect. Mom. Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer. Smile. There you go. Oh. Sir, you don\\'t have to drive us. Nah, nah, it\\'s not a big deal. I\\'m going out of town. It\\'s right on my way. He\\'s always coming and going. Last time. Have fun. Thank you. Promise. He\\'s cute. Shh. See you in a couple of days. Bye, baby. All right. Come on, Pedro. Bye, Peter. Have fun. Yeah, I will. What are you gonna do, Pete? What? When you graduate, what do you think you\\'ll do? Oh, I don\\'t know. Don\\'t grill him, dad. Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school you pretty much have your life planned out, right? Yeah, no, I\\'m just a sophomore. Peter has an internship with Tony stark. So I think he doesn\\'t have to worry. Really? Mm-hm. - Stark? - So cool. Oh. What do you do? Actually, I don\\'t intern for him anymore. Seriously? Yeah, it got... Boring. It was boring? You got to hang out with spider-man. Really? Spider-man? Wow. What\\'s he like? Yeah, he\\'s nice. Nice man. Solid dude. Hm. Look. So cute. Oh. I\\'ve seen you around, right? I mean, somewhere. We\\'ve... have we ever...? Because even the voice... He does academic decathlon with me. Oh. And he was at my party. - Ah. - It was a great party. Really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows. You were there for, like, two seconds. That was... I was there longer than two seconds. You disappeared. No. No, I did not disappear. Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C. too. That\\'s terrible what happened down there in D.C. though. Were you scared? I\\'ll bet you were glad when your old pal spider-man showed up in the elevator though, huh? Yeah, well, I actually didn\\'t go up. I saw it all from the ground. Yeah. Very lucky that he was there that day. Good old spider-man. Dad, the light. Here we are. End of the line. Thanks, dad. You head in there, gumdrop. I\\'m gonna give Peter the \"dad\" talk. Don\\'t let him intimidate you. Love you. Love you, gumdrop. Have a safe flight. Hi. You guys look so pretty. Does she know? Know what? So she doesn\\'t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I\\'ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn\\'t want my daughter to date... Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter\\'s life. I could never forget something like that. So I\\'m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened and don\\'t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. \\'Cause if you do, I\\'ll kill you and everybody you love. I\\'ll kill you dead. That\\'s what I\\'ll do to protect my family, Pete. Do you understand? Hey. I just saved your life. Now what do you say? Thank you. You\\'re welcome. Now, you go on in there, you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good. Hey. What did he say to you? I\\'ve got to go. I\\'m... I\\'m sorry. You don\\'t deserve this. Ah! He gave you a choice. You chose wrong. What the hell? What\\'s with the crappy costume? My web-shooters. Whoa! I wasn\\'t sure about this thing at first, but... Damn. Oh, gross. Why did he send you here? Guess you\\'ll never know. Huh? Nice shot! Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz\\'s dad. What? I know. I gotta tell Mr. stark. Call happy hogan. He\\'s Mr. stark\\'s head of security. Get a computer and track my phone for me. Are you gonna be okay? Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town. I\\'m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino\\'s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So... ah! Flash, I need your car and your phone. Sir, technically, this is my dad\\'s car, sir, so I can\\'t... Ah! Hello, ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me? Go for ned. Ned, I need you to track my phone for me. Yeah, but where is it? Genius move. Okay, he just passed the gamestop on Jackson Avenue. Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I\\'m in flash\\'s car. I\\'ll pull the specs. Okay, you\\'re on speakerphone. You stole flash\\'s car? Awesome. Yeah, it\\'s awesome! It\\'s awe... Oh! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Peter, are you okay? I\\'ve never driven before. Only with may in parking lots. This is a huge step up. Whoa! Hey, have you gotten through to happy yet? Uh, yeah. I\\'m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system. Guy in the chair. Takeoff in nine minutes. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Mr. happy, it\\'s ned. Who? I\\'m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something important to tell you... You gotta be shitting me. Damn. Hey, ned, how we coming with those headlights? Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise. Left, okay. Okay, perfect. So where\\'s my phone now? Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn. What? That makes no sense! I thought he said he was going out of town! Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. happy. Don\\'t think he likes you, by the way. Sounded like he was catching a flight. Something about taking off in nine minutes. What? He was surrounded by boxes. Boxes? It\\'s moving day. It\\'s moving day. He\\'s gonna rob that plane. I gotta stop him! All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony\\'s old hulkbuster armor, prototype for cap\\'s new shield, and the meging... The Meg... the... Thor\\'s magic belt. Okay, slow down. You\\'re getting close. It\\'s on your right. What? Turn right! Turn right! Peter, are you okay? Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to happy. It\\'s been an honor, spider-man. What are you doing here? There\\'s a dance. Uh... I\\'m looking at porn. Hey! Surprised? Oh, hey, Pete. I didn\\'t hear you come in. It\\'s over. I\\'ve got you. You know, i gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn\\'t sure. I thought, \"really?\" But I get it now. How could you do this to her? To her? I\\'m not doing anything to her, Pete. I\\'m doing this for her. Huh, yeah. Peter, you\\'re young. You don\\'t understand how the world works. Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong. How do you think your buddy stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don\\'t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don\\'t care about us. We have to pick up after \\'em. We have to eat their table scraps. That\\'s how it is. I know you know what I\\'m talking about, Peter. Why are you telling me this? Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne. I\\'m sorry, Peter. What are you talking about? That thing hasn\\'t even touched me yet. True. Then again, wasn\\'t really trying to. Chief, they\\'re powering up engines. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, god. Okay, ready? Hello! Hello! Please. Hey. Hey, please. I\\'m down here. I\\'m down here. I\\'m stuck. I\\'m stuck. I can\\'t move. I can\\'t... If you\\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\\'t have it. Come on, Peter. Come on, spider-man. Come on, spider-man. Come on, spider-man. Come on, spider-man! Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light. Oh, yeah. Retroreflective panels engaged. Got a visual on the plane, but I\\'m feeling a little resistance. It\\'s probably just drag on the new turbines. Ah! Whoa! Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal. This better work, Mason. Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes and we are set for life. Yeah. Hey! Ah! Whew. You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security. Cloning transponder signal. Launching decoy drone. Whoa. Entering new coordinates. Good, so it\\'s on its way? Yes, sir, right on course. Okay, thank you. All right. Hot dog. Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... ah! Fighting my girlfriend\\'s dad. Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh, god! Whew. I can\\'t believe that worked. Chief, they\\'re losing altitude. Get out of there. I\\'m not going home empty-handed. Oh, my god. - Get out of there. - What are you doing? Please turn! Please turn! Hey, Pedro. Bingo. Your wingsuit. Your wingsuit\\'s gonna explode! Time to go home, Pete. I\\'m trying to save you! No! No. No! Ah! Ah! It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He was just, like... And you were like, \"ah!\" And then I just hit him with the \"fffew.\" It was so... Oh, my god. You saved me. It was awesome. Hey, Liz. I\\'m gonna miss you. Bye. Liz. Liz, look, I\\'m so sorry. You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time? The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do. Well, yeah, but i... I mean, your dad... I can\\'t imagine what you\\'re going through. If there\\'s anything i can do to help... I guess we\\'re moving to Oregon. Mom says it\\'s nice there, so that\\'s cool. Anyways, dad doesn\\'t want us here during the trial, so... Liz, i... i... Bye, Peter. Whatever\\'s going on with you, I hope you figure it out. Congratulations, decathlon national champions. Yeah! I\\'m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I\\'m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I am appointing Michelle. Yeah! Uh, thank you. My... my friends call me mj. I thought you didn\\'t have any friends. I didn\\'t. I gotta go. Hey, where you going? What are you hiding, Peter? I\\'m just kidding. I don\\'t care. Bye. All right, so we should run some drills. Yeah. Hey, happy. What... What are you doing here? I really owe you one. I don\\'t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony... So how long you been here? Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you. Is he here too? In the toilet? No, he\\'s upstate. Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate? Yeah, let\\'s go. Take a look. It\\'s pretty impressive, huh? They just finished remodeling the whole thing. You don\\'t see that every day. Oh, there they are. How was the ride up? Good. Give me a minute with the kid. Seriously? Yeah. I got to talk to the kid. I\\'ll be close behind. How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good. Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on? Wouldn\\'t you think? Don\\'t you think? I guess. Let\\'s just say it was. Mr. stark, I really... You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies. All right, not my best analogy. I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team. To the... to the team? Yeah. Anyway, there\\'s about 50 reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers. When you\\'re ready, why don\\'t you try that on? And I\\'ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the avengers: Spider-man. I... heh. Yeah, give that a look. So after the press conference, happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. Where\\'s he between? He\\'s next to vision? Yeah, vision\\'s not big on doors. It\\'s fun. Or walls. You\\'ll fit right in. Thank you, Mr. stark, but I\\'m... I\\'m good. You\\'re good? How are you good? Well, I mean, I\\'d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood spider-man. Somebody\\'s got to look out for the little guy, right? You\\'re turning me down? You better think about this. Look at that. Look at me. Last chance. Yes or no? No. Okay. It\\'s kind of a Springsteen-y, working-class hero vibe that I dig. Ah, happy will take you home. Yeah? Yeah. Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute. Thank you, Mr. stark. Yes, Mr. Parker, very well. See you around. Okay. That was a test, right? There\\'s nobody back there? Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck. Thank you, Mr. stark. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Told you he was a good kid. Pepper! Pepper! Where\\'s the kid? He left. Everybody\\'s waiting. He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us. Did you guys screw this up? He told the kid to wait in the car. Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them? Think of something. How about, um, hap, you still got that ring? Do i... i... The engagement ring. Are you kidding? I\\'ve been carrying this since 2008. Okay. I think I can think of something better than that. Well, it would buy us a little time. Like we need time. I can\\'t believe you have that thing in your pocket. Let me to get the door for you, hon? I got it. Aunt may, did you do dinner already? May? What the f...?! Look who it is. What are the odds you and I\\'d end up at the same summer camp? Relax. This? It\\'s not on you. It\\'s on our little spider friend. I\\'ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... You know who he is. If I knew who he was, he\\'d already be dead. Toomes, your family\\'s here! Hi, I\\'m captain America, here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes Patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little and it seems like it\\'s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing. How many more of these? On your left. On your left. On my left. Got it. Don\\'t say it. Don\\'t you say it. - On your left. - Come on! Need a medic? I need a new set of lungs. Dude, you just ran, like, 13 miles in 30 minutes. I guess I got a late start. Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap. Did you just take it? I assume you just took it. What unit you with? 58th Pararescue. But now I\\'m working down at the VA. - Sam Wilson. - Steve Rogers. I kind of put that together. Must have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing. It takes some getting used to. It\\'s good to meet you, Sam. It\\'s your bed, right? What\\'s that? Your bed, it\\'s too soft. When I was over there, I\\'d sleep on the ground, use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I\\'m home, lying in my bed, and it\\'s like... Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I\\'m gonna sink right to the floor. How long? Two tours. You must miss the good old days, huh? Well, things aren\\'t so bad. Food\\'s a lot better. We used to boil everything. No polio is good. Internet, so helpful. I\\'ve been reading that a lot, trying to catch up. Marvin Gaye, 1972, Trouble Man soundtrack. Everything you missed jammed into one album. I\\'ll put it on the list. All right, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that\\'s what you want to call running. That\\'s how it is? - That\\'s how it is. - Okay. Any time you want to stop by the VA, make me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know. - I\\'ll keep it in mind. - Yeah. Hey, fellas. Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I\\'m here to pick up a fossil. That\\'s hilarious. - How you doing? - Hey. Can\\'t run everywhere. No, you can\\'t. Target is a mobile satellite launch platform, the Lemurian Star. They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago. - Any demands? - Billion and a half. - Why so steep? - Because it\\'s S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s. So it\\'s not off-course. It\\'s trespassing. I\\'m sure they have a good reason. You know, I\\'m getting a little tired of being Fury\\'s janitor. Relax. It\\'s not that complicated. How many pirates? 25. Top mercs led by this guy. Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He\\'s at the top of Interpol\\'s Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had 36 kill missions. This guy\\'s got a rep for maximum casualties. Hostages? Mostly techs. One officer. Jasper Sitwell. They\\'re in the galley. What\\'s Sitwell doing on a launch ship? All right, I\\'m gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get them out. Let\\'s move. S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up. Secure channel seven. Seven secure. Did you do anything fun Saturday night? Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so, no, not really. Coming up on the drop zone, Cap. You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she\\'d probably say yes. That\\'s why I don\\'t ask. Too shy, or too scared? Too busy! Was he wearing a parachute? No. No, he wasn\\'t. Hey! Don\\'t move. Thanks. Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me. What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice. Secure the engine room, then find me a date. I\\'m multi-tasking. I told Batroc... If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us... We have to start sending them bodies now! I have a bullet for someone... You want a bullet in your head? Move that foot. You want a bullet in the head...? I don\\'t like waiting. Call Durand. I want this ship ready to move when the ransom comes. Start the engines. Okay. Hey, sailor. Shut up. You want to be a hero? Is that it? All right, I\\'ve waited long enough... Hey! Find Batroc... If I don\\'t hear anything in two minutes... I\\'ll start killing them! I\\'ll find him. Two minutes. Radio silence from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc... Targets acquired. S.T.R.I.K.E. in position. Natasha, what\\'s your status? Status, Natasha. Hang on! Engine room secure. Time is up. Who wants to die first...? You! Get that one. On my mark. Three... Two... One. I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn\\'t negotiate. The line just went dead. I\\'ve lost contact with them... Hostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap. Hostiles are still in play. Natasha, Batroc\\'s on the move. Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages. Natasha. I thought you were more than just a shield... Let\\'s see. Well, this is awkward. What are you doing? Backing up the hard drive. It\\'s a good habit to get into. Rumlow needed your help. What the hell are you doing here? You\\'re saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel. Whatever I can get my hands on. Our mission is to rescue hostages. No, that\\'s your mission, and you\\'ve done it beautifully. You just jeopardized this whole operation. I think that\\'s overstating things. Okay. That one\\'s on me. You\\'re damn right. You just can\\'t stop yourself from lying, can you? I didn\\'t lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours. Which you didn\\'t feel obliged to share. I\\'m not obliged to do anything. Those hostages could have died, Nick. I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn\\'t happen. Soldiers trust each other. That\\'s what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns. Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn\\'t want you doing anything you weren\\'t comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything. I can\\'t lead a mission when the people I\\'m leading have missions of their own. It\\'s called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets, because nobody knows them all. Except you. You\\'re wrong about me. I do share. I\\'m nice like that. - Insight bay. - Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight. Director override. Fury, Nicholas J. Confirmed. You know, they used to play music. Yeah. My grandfather operated one of these things for 40 years. Granddad worked in a nice building. Got good tips. He\\'d walk home every night, a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He\\'d say, \"Hi.\" People would say, \"Hi\" back. Time went on, the neighborhood got rougher. He\\'d say, \"Hi.\" They\\'d say, \"Keep on steppin\\'.\" Granddad got to gripping that lunch bag a little tighter. Did he ever get mugged? Every week some punk would say, \"What\\'s in the bag?\" What would he do? He\\'d show them. Bunch of crumpled ones, and a loaded .22 Magnum. Yeah, Granddad loved people. But he didn\\'t trust them very much. Yeah, I know. They\\'re a little bit bigger than a .22. This is Project Insight. Three next-generation helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites. Launched from the Lemurian Star. Once we get them in the air, they never need to come down. Continuous sub-orbital flight, courtesy of our new repulsor engines. Stark? He had a few suggestions once he got an up-close look at our old turbines. These new long-range precision guns can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist\\'s DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We\\'re gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen. Thought the punishment usually came after the crime. We can\\'t afford to wait that long. Who\\'s \"we\"? After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once, we\\'re way ahead of the curve. By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection. You know, I read those SSR files. \"Greatest Generation\"? You guys did some nasty stuff. Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so that people could be free. This isn\\'t freedom. This is fear. S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we\\'d like it to be. And it\\'s getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap. Don\\'t hold your breath. Welcome to the Smithsonian. Visitor information booths are available on the second level. A symbol to the nation. A hero to the world. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice. Denied enlistment due to poor health, Steven Rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of American warfare. One that would transform him into the world\\'s first Super-Soldier. In this rare footage, everyone\\'s favorite war hero, Captain America... Battle tested, Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes. Their mission: taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division. Best friends since childhood, Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country. That was a difficult winter. A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line. Steve, Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over 1,000 men. Including the man who would... Who would become my husband, as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life. You should be proud of yourself, Peggy. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn\\'t get to live yours. What is it? For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I\\'m not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders. Serve. It\\'s just not the same. You\\'re always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather mucked it up. You didn\\'t. Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay. Hey. The world has changed, and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best. And sometimes the best that we can do is to start over. Peggy. Steve. Yeah? You\\'re alive. You came back. Yeah, Peggy. It\\'s been so long. So long. Well, I couldn\\'t leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance. Secure office. Open Lemurian Star\\'s satellite launch file. Access denied. Run decryption. Decryption failed. Director override. Fury, Nicholas J. Override denied. All files sealed. On whose authority? Fury, Nicholas J. World Security Council. Confirmed. If Nick Fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to mop up his mess, he\\'s sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable. Considering this attack took place one mile from my country\\'s sovereign waters, it\\'s a bit more than that. I move for immediate hearing. We don\\'t need hearings, we need action. It\\'s this Council\\'s duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D. A breach like this raises serious questions. Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel in broad daylight? For the record, Councilman, he\\'s Algerian. I can draw a map if it\\'d help. I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce. But this Council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously. Really? I don\\'t. I don\\'t care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fall to rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee US. Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting... Excuse me. More trouble, Mr. Secretary? Depends on your definition. I work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit? A nuclear war would do it, too. You busy in there? Nothing some earmarks can\\'t fix. I\\'m here to ask a favor. I want you to call for a vote. Project Insight has to be delayed. Nick, that\\'s not a favor, that\\'s a sub-committee hearing. Along one. It could be nothing. It probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it\\'s nothing. But if it\\'s something? Then we\\'ll both be damn glad those helicarriers aren\\'t in the air. Fine. But you got to get Iron Man to stop by my niece\\'s birthday party. Thank you, sir. And not just a flyby. He\\'s got to mingle. The thing is, I think it\\'s getting worse. A cop pulled me over last week. He thought I was drunk. I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED. Some stuff you leave there. Other stuff you bring back. It\\'s our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase, or in a little man-purse? It\\'s up to you. - I\\'ll see you next week. - Definitely. Look who it is, the running man. Caught the last few minutes. It\\'s pretty intense. Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems. Guilt, regret. You lose someone? My wingman, Riley. Flying a night mission. Standard PJ rescue op. Nothing we hadn\\'t done 1,000 times before. Until an RPG knocked Riley\\'s dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. It\\'s like I was up there just to watch. - I\\'m sorry. - After that, I had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know? But you\\'re happy now, back in the world? The number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell yeah. Are you thinking about getting out? No. I don\\'t know. To be honest, I don\\'t know what I would do with myself if I did. Ultimate fighting? Just a great idea off the top of my head. Seriously, you could do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy? I don\\'t know. Activating communications encryption protocol. Open secure line 0405. Confirmed. This is Hill. I need you here in D.C. Deep shadow conditions. Give me four hours. You have three. Over. Want to see my lease? Fracture detected. Recommend anesthetic injection. D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area. Get me out of here. Propulsion systems offline. Then reboot, damn it! Warning. Window integrity compromised. You think? How long to propulsion? Calculating. Window integrity 31%. Deploying countermeasures. Hold that order! Window integrity 19%. Offensive measures advised. Wait! Window integrity 1%. Now! Propulsion systems now online. Full acceleration! Now! Initiate vertical takeoff! Flight systems damaged. Then activate guidance cameras! Give me the wheel! Get me Agent Hill. Communications array damaged. Well, what\\'s not damaged? Air conditioning is fully operational. Traffic ahead. Give me an alternate route. Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. All vehicles stopped. 17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead. Warning. Approaching intersection. Get me off the grid! Calculating route to secure location. So sweet. That is so nice. Hi. I got to go, though. Okay. Bye. My aunt, she\\'s kind of an insomniac. Yeah. Hey, if you want... If you want, you\\'re welcome to use my machine. Might be cheaper than the one in the basement. Yeah? What\\'s it cost? A cup of coffee? Thank you, but I already have a load in downstairs, and you really don\\'t want my scrubs in your machine. I just finished a rotation in the infectious disease ward, so... Well, I\\'ll keep my distance. Hopefully, not too far. And I think you left your stereo on. Right. Thank you. Yeah. I don\\'t remember giving you a key. You really think I\\'d need one? My wife kicked me out. I didn\\'t know you were married. A lot of things you don\\'t know about me. I know, Nick. That\\'s the problem. I\\'m sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. Who else knows about your wife? Just... My friends. Is that what we are? That\\'s up to you. Don\\'t trust anyone. Captain Rogers? Captain, I\\'m Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Service. Kate? I\\'m assigned to protect you. On whose order? His. Foxtrot is down, he\\'s unresponsive. I need EMTs. Do we have a 20 on the shooter? Tell him I\\'m in pursuit. Is he gonna make it? I don\\'t know. Tell me about the shooter. He\\'s fast. Strong. Had a metal arm. Ballistics? Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable. Soviet-made. Yeah. He\\'s in V-tach. - Crash cart coming in. - Nurse, help me with the drape. - BP\\'s dropping. - Defibrillator! I want you to charge him at 100. Don\\'t do this to me, Nick. Stand back. Three, two, one. Clear. - Pulse? - No pulse. Okay, 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! Get me epinephrine! Pulse? Negative. Don\\'t do this to me, Nick. Don\\'t do this to me. What\\'s the time? 1:03, Doctor. Time of death, 1:03 a.m. I need to take him. Natasha. Natasha! Why was Fury in your apartment? I don\\'t know. Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D. Yeah, give me a second. They want you now. Okay. You\\'re a terrible liar. S.T.R.I.K.E. team, escort Captain Rogers back to S.H.I.E.L.D. immediately for questioning. I told him. - Let\\'s go. - Yeah. S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out. Captain Rogers. Neighbor. Captain. I\\'m Alexander Pierce. Sir, it\\'s an honor. The honor\\'s mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met, when I was at State Department in Bogota. E.L.N. rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was Deputy Chief of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there, and he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, \"No, we\\'ll negotiate.\" Turned out, the E.L.N. didn\\'t negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what do they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order, and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil, and saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter. So you gave him a promotion. I\\'ve never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night? I don\\'t know. Did you know it was bugged? I did, because Nick told me. Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? I want you to see something. Who hired you, Batroc? Is that live? Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers. Are you saying he\\'s a suspect? Assassination isn\\'t Batroc\\'s line. No, no. It\\'s more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star. And he was contacted by email and paid by wire transfer, and then the money was run through 17 fictitious accounts. The last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech. Am I supposed to know who that is? Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 1435 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick, his mother lived at 1437. Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why? The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick\\'s death. If you really knew Nick Fury, you\\'d know that\\'s not true. Why do you think we\\'re talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to, but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that, despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today makes me really, really angry. Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don\\'t think that\\'s an accident. And I don\\'t think you do, either. So, I\\'m gonna ask again. Why was he there? He told me not to trust anyone. I wonder if that included him. I\\'m sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. Captain, somebody murdered my friend and I\\'m gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they\\'re gonna regret it. Anyone. Understood. Operations Control. Confirmed. Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site. - Understood. - Yes, sir. - Forensics. - Confirmed. Cap. Rumlow. Evidence Response found some fibers on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac team ready? No, let\\'s wait and see what it is first. Right. What\\'s the status so far? - Administrations level. - Confirmed. Excuse me. I\\'m sorry about what happened with Fury. It\\'s messed up, what happened to him. Thank you. Records. Confirmed. Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor. Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this isn\\'t personal! It kind of feels personal. Drop the shield and put your hands in the air! Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! Are you kidding me? He\\'s headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge. Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. Repeat, stand down. Eyes here. Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here. Scan all open sources, phones, computers, PDAs. Whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it. With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why. Because he lied to us. Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury. He refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D. - Where is it? - Safe. - Do better. - Where did you get it? Why would I tell you? Fury gave it to you. Why? - What\\'s on it? - I don\\'t know. Stop lying. I only act like I know everything, Rogers. I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn\\'t you? Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you. I\\'m not gonna ask you again. I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn\\'t believe he exists. The ones that do call him the Winter Soldier. He\\'s credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last 50 years. So he\\'s a ghost story. Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. Somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out. But the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer so he shot him straight through me. Soviet slug. No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis. Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. Going after him is a dead end. I know, I\\'ve tried. Like you said, he\\'s a ghost story. Well, let\\'s find out what the ghost wants. Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor. You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship. Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this Council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst... Are you calling for my resignation? I\\'ve got a pen and paper right here. That discussion can be tabled for a later time. But you do want to have a discussion? We\\'ve already had it, Mr. Secretary. This Council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time. First rule of going on the run is don\\'t run, walk. If I run in these shoes, they\\'re gonna fall off. The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D. will know exactly where we are. How much time will we have? About nine minutes from now. Fury was right about that ship. Somebody\\'s trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI. It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands. Can you override it? The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. I\\'m gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed to track hostile malware, so if we can\\'t read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from. Can I help you guys with anything? No. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations. Right. We\\'re getting married. Congratulations. Where are you guys thinking about going? New Jersey. I have the exact same glasses. Wow, you two are practically twins. Yeah, I wish. Specimen. If you guys need anything, I\\'ve been Aaron. Thank you. - You said nine minutes. Come on. - Relax. Got it. You know it? I used to. Let\\'s go. Standard tac team. Two behind, two across, and two coming straight at us. If they make us, I\\'ll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. Shut up and put your arm around me. Laugh at something I said. - What? - Do it. Negative at the source. Give me a floor rundown. Negative on three. Negative on two. Snake the upper levels. Work down to me. - Kiss me. - What? Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable. Yes, they do. You still uncomfortable? It\\'s not exactly the word I would use. Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car? Nazi Germany. And we\\'re borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. All right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer. I feel like, if you don\\'t answer it though, - you\\'re kind of answering it, you know. - What? Was that your first kiss since 1945? - That bad, huh? - I didn\\'t say that. Well, it kind of sounds like that\\'s what you\\'re saying. No, I didn\\'t. I just wondered how much practice you\\'ve had. - You don\\'t need practice. - Everybody needs practice. It was not my first kiss since 1945. I\\'m 95, I\\'m not dead. Nobody special, though? Believe it or not, it\\'s kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience. Well, that\\'s all right. You just make something up. - What, like you? - I don\\'t know. The truth is a matter of circumstance. It\\'s not all things to all people, all the time. Neither am I. That\\'s a tough way to live. It\\'s a good way not to die, though. You know, it\\'s kind of hard to trust someone, when you don\\'t know who that someone really is. Yeah. Who do you want me to be? How about a friend? Well, there\\'s a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers. This is it. The file came from these coordinates. So did I. This camp is where I was trained. Change much? A little. Pick up the pace, ladies! Let\\'s go! Let\\'s go! Double time! Come on, Rogers, move it! Come on, fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! This is a dead end. Zero heat signatures, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. What is it? Army regulations forbid storing munitions within 500 yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. This is S.H.I.E.L.D. Maybe where it started. And there\\'s Stark\\'s father. Howard. Who\\'s the girl? If you\\'re already working in a secret office, why do you need to hide the elevator? This can\\'t be the data point. This technology is ancient. Y-E-S spells yes. Shall we play a game? - It\\'s from a movie that was really... - I know, I saw it. Rogers, Steven, born 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, born 1984. It\\'s some kind of recording. I am not a recording, Fraulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945. But I am. You know this thing? Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He\\'s been dead for years. First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body. My mind, however, that was worth saving, on 200,000 feet of databanks. You are standing in my brain. - How did you get here? - Invited. It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German scientists with strategic value. They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own. HYDRA died With the Red Skull. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Prove it. Accessing archive. HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D. For 70 years, HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war, and when history did not cooperate, history was changed. That\\'s impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you. Accidents will happen. HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once a purification process is complete, HYDRA\\'s new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your life. A zero sum. As I was saying... What\\'s on this drive? Project Insight requires insight. So, I wrote an algorithm. What kind of algorithm? What does it do? The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. - 30 seconds tops. - Who fired it? S.H.I.E.L.D. I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it. It\\'s better this way. We are, both of us, out of time. Call in the asset. I\\'m going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave? No... It\\'s fine, Renata, you can go home. Okay. Night-night. Good night. Want some milk? The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in 10 hours. Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I... I forgot my phone. Renata, I wish you would have knocked. Hey, man. I\\'m sorry about this. We need a place to lay low. Everyone we know is trying to kill us. Not everyone. - You okay? - Yeah. What\\'s going on? When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D. I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but I guess I can\\'t tell the difference anymore. There\\'s a chance you might be in the wrong business. I owe you. It\\'s okay. If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, now you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it? I would now. And I\\'m always honest. Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing. Well, guess I just like to know who I\\'m fighting. I made breakfast. If you guys eat that sort of thing. So, the question is, who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch a domestic missile strike? Pierce. Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world. But he\\'s not working alone. Zola\\'s algorithm was on the Lemurian Star. So was Jasper Sitwell. So, the real question is, how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight? The answer is, you don\\'t. - What\\'s this? - Call it a résumé. Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you? You didn\\'t say he was a Pararescue. - Is this Riley? - Yeah. I heard they couldn\\'t bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use? A stealth chute? No. These. I thought you said you were a pilot. I never said pilot. I can\\'t ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason. Dude, Captain America needs my help. There\\'s no better reason to get back in. Where can we get our hands on one of these things? The last one is at Fort Meade. Behind three guarded gates and a 12-inch steel wall. Shouldn\\'t be a problem. Listen, I got to fly home tonight because I got some constituency problem and I got to press the flesh. Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator? No, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot, you know? Wants to be a reporter, I think. I don\\'t know. Who listens at that point? Doesn\\'t sound like much of a problem to me. Really? Because she\\'s killing my back. But this isn\\'t the place to talk about it. This is a nice pin. - Thank you. - Come here. Hail HYDRA. - See, it\\'s right there... - Yeah, I just saw that. - Should I get it checked? - I think you should. I need a minute. Bring the car around. Yes, sir? Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious. Who is this? The good-looking guy in the sunglasses, your 10 o\\'clock. Your other 10 o\\'clock. There you go. What do you want? You\\'re gonna go around the corner to your right. There\\'s a gray car two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride. And why would I do that? Because that tie looks really expensive, and I\\'d hate to mess it up. Tell me about Zola\\'s algorithm. Never heard of it. What were you doing on the Lemurian Star? I was throwing up. I get seasick. Is this little display meant to insinuate that you\\'re gonna throw me off the roof? Because it\\'s really not your style, Rogers. You\\'re right. It\\'s not. It\\'s hers. Wait. What about that girl from Accounting, Laura... Lillian. Lip piercing, right? Yeah, she\\'s cute. Yeah. I\\'m not ready for that. Zola\\'s algorithm is a program for choosing - Insight\\'s targets. - What targets? You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defense, a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City, Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who\\'s a threat to HYDRA. Now, or in the future. In the future? How could it know? How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores! Zola\\'s algorithm evaluates people\\'s past to predict their future. And what then? Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me. What then? Then the Insight helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time. HYDRA doesn\\'t like leaks. Then why don\\'t you try sticking a cork in it? Insight\\'s launching in 16 hours. We\\'re cutting it a little bit close here. I know. We\\'ll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the helicarriers directly. What? Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. Shit! Hang on! I have her. Find him. Go! I got this! Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. I make an LZ, 2300 block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous, two minutes. Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! Bucky? Who the hell is Bucky? Drop the shield, Cap! Get on your knees! Get on your knees! Get down, get down! Get on your knees! Down! Don\\'t move. Put the gun down. Not here. Not here! It was him. He looked right at me like he didn\\'t even know me. How is that even possible? It was, like, 70 years ago. Zola. Bucky\\'s whole unit was captured in \\'43. Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and... None of that\\'s your fault, Steve. Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. We need to get a doctor here. If we don\\'t put pressure on that wound, she\\'s gonna bleed out here in the truck. That thing was squeezing my brain. Who is this guy? Three holes. Start digging. GSW. She\\'s lost at least a pint. Maybe two. - Let me take her. - She\\'ll want to see him first. About damn time. Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, and one hell of a headache. Don\\'t forget your collapsed lung. Let\\'s not forget that. Otherwise, I\\'m good. They cut you open. Your heart stopped. Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn\\'t work so great for him, but we found a use for it. Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us? Any attempt on the Director\\'s life had to look successful. Can\\'t kill you if you\\'re already dead. Besides, I wasn\\'t sure who to trust. Sergeant Barnes. Bucky, no! The procedure has already started. You are to be the new fist of HYDRA. Put him on ice. Sir. He\\'s unstable. Erratic. Mission report. Mission report now. The man on the bridge. Who was he? You met him earlier this week on another assignment. I knew him. Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century. And I need you to do it one more time. Society\\'s at a tipping point between order and chaos. And tomorrow morning, we\\'re gonna give it a push. But, if you don\\'t do your part, I can\\'t do mine. And HYDRA can\\'t give the world the freedom it deserves. But I knew him. Prep him. He\\'s been out of cryo freeze too long. Then wipe him and start over. This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said peace wasn\\'t an achievement, it was a responsibility. See, it\\'s stuff like this that gives me trust issues. We have to stop the launch. I don\\'t think the Council\\'s accepting my calls anymore. What\\'s that? Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet, they\\'ll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponized. We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own. One or two won\\'t cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational, a whole lot of people are gonna die. We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We have to get past them, insert these server blades. And maybe, just maybe we can salvage what\\'s left... We\\'re not salvaging anything. We\\'re not just taking down the carriers, Nick. We\\'re taking down S.H.I.E.L.D. S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this. You gave me this mission. This is how it ends. S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s been compromised. You said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed. Why do you think we\\'re meeting in this cave? I noticed. How many paid the price before you did? Look, I didn\\'t know about Barnes. Even if you had, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that, too? S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, it all goes. He\\'s right. Don\\'t look at me. I do what he does, just slower. Well... It looks like you\\'re giving the orders now, Captain. We looked for you, after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery. I know, I\\'m sorry. I just kind of wanted to be alone. How was it? It was okay. She\\'s next to Dad. I was gonna ask... I know what you\\'re gonna say, Buck. I just... We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It\\'ll be fun. All you got to do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash. Come on. Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own. The thing is, you don\\'t have to. I\\'m with you to the end of the line, pal. He\\'s gonna be there, you know. I know. Look, whoever he used to be and the guy he is now, I don\\'t think he\\'s the kind you save. He\\'s the kind you stop. I don\\'t know if I can do that. Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn\\'t know you. He will. Gear up. It\\'s time. You gonna wear that? No. If you\\'re gonna fight a war, you got to wear a uniform. Oh, man. I am so fired. We are in final launch sequence. We are go on guidance. All personnel to launch stations. And how was your flight? Lovely. The ride from the airport, less so. Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can\\'t control everything. Including Captain America. This facility is biometrically controlled. And these will give you unrestricted access. I\\'ve been parking there for two months. - But it\\'s his spot. - So where\\'s he been? I think Afghanistan. Negative DT Six. The pattern is full. Well, he could\\'ve said something. Must be the dish. I\\'ll check it out. Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch. Excuse us. I know the road hasn\\'t exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally, we\\'re here. And the world should be grateful. Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, this is Steve Rogers. You\\'ve heard a lot about me over the last few days. Some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it\\'s time you know the truth. S.H.I.E.L.D. is not what we thought it was. It\\'s been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don\\'t know how many more, but I know they\\'re in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want. Absolute control. They shot Nick Fury. And it won\\'t end there. If you launch those helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way. Unless we stop them. I know I\\'m asking a lot. But the price of freedom is high. It always has been. And it\\'s a price I\\'m willing to pay. And if I\\'m the only one, then so be it. But I\\'m willing to bet I\\'m not. Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? You smug son of a bitch. Arrest him. I guess I\\'ve got the floor. Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now. Is there a problem? Is there a problem? I\\'m sorry, sir. I\\'m not gonna launch those ships. Captain\\'s orders. Move away from your station. Like he said... Hold it right there. Put the gun down! Captain\\'s orders. You picked the wrong side, Agent. Depends on where you\\'re standing. Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door! They\\'re initiating launch. Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys? If they\\'re shooting at you, they\\'re bad. Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about. You okay? I\\'m not dead yet. Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow and you knew that they were going to drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution, and you could just stop it, with a flick of the switch. Wouldn\\'t you? Wouldn\\'t you all? Not if it was your switch. I\\'m sorry. Did I step on your moment? Satellites in range at 3,000 feet. Falcon, status? Engaging. All right, Cap. I\\'m in. Oh, shit. Eight minutes, Cap. Working on it. What are you doing? She\\'s disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet. - Including HYDRA\\'S. - And S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s. If you do this, none of your past is gonna remain hidden. Are you sure you\\'re ready for the world to see you as you really are? Are you? Alpha lock. Falcon, where are you now? I had to take a detour. Oh, yeah! I\\'m in. Bravo lock. Two down, one to go. All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble. We\\'re the only air support Captain Rogers has got. Disabling the encryption is an executive order. It takes two Alpha Level members. Don\\'t worry. Company\\'s coming. Did you get my flowers? - I\\'m glad you\\'re here, Nick. - Really? Because I thought you had me killed. You know how the game works. So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Because you were the best, and the most ruthless person I ever met. I did what I did to protect people. Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder. War. It\\'s just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? A holding action, Nick. A band-aid. And you know where I learned that. Bogota. You didn\\'t ask. You just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing 20 million. It\\'s the next step, Nick. If you have the courage to take it. No. I have the courage not to. Retinal scanner active. You don\\'t think we\\'ve wiped your clearance from the system? I know you erased my password. Probably deleted my retinal scan. But if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary, you need to keep both eyes open. Alpha level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed. Charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow. Six minutes. Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride. Roger. Let me know when you\\'re ready. I just did! You know, you\\'re a lot heavier than you look. I had a big breakfast. Steve! Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay? Yeah, I\\'m here. I\\'m still on the helicarrier. - Where are you? - I\\'m grounded. The suit\\'s down. Sorry, Cap. Don\\'t worry. I got it. Emergency evacuation alert. All personnel, proceed to designated safety zones. All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents regroup at Rally Point Delta. Sir, the Council\\'s been breached. - Repeat, Dispatch. - Black Widow\\'s up there. Headed up. - Falcon? - Yeah. Rumlow\\'s headed for the Council. I\\'m on it. People are gonna die, Buck. I can\\'t let that happen. Please don\\'t make me do this. Done. And it\\'s trending. Unless you want a two-inch hole in your sternum, I\\'d put that gun down. That was armed the moment you pinned it on. Drop it! Drop it! I\\'m on 41, headed toward the southwest stairwell. This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA. Just order. And order only comes through pain. - You ready for yours? - Man, shut the hell up. Lieutenant, how much longer? 65 seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now. One minute. 30 seconds, Cap. Stand by. Charlie... We\\'ve reached 3,000 feet. Sat link coming online now. Deploy algorithm. Algorithm deployed. We are go to target. Target saturation reached. All targets assigned. Fire when ready. Firing in... Three, two... One. Charlie lock. Where are the targets? Where are the targets? Okay, Cap, get out of there. Fire now. - But, Steve... - Do it! Do it now! What a waste. So, you still on the fence about Rogers\\' chances? Time to go, Councilwoman. This way. Come on. You\\'re going to fly me out of here. You know, there was a time I would\\'ve taken a bullet for you. You already did. You will again, when it\\'s useful. Romanoff. Natasha. Natasha! Come on! Those really do sting. Hail HYDRA. You\\'re out of your depth, kid. Son of a bitch! Please tell me you got that chopper in the air! Sam, where are you? 41st floor! Northwest corner! We\\'re on it! Stay where you are! Not an option! 41st floor! 41st! It\\'s not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building. Hill! Where\\'s Steve? You got a location on Rogers? You know me. No, I don\\'t! Bucky. You\\'ve known me your whole life. Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. Shut up! I\\'m not gonna fight you. You\\'re my friend. You\\'re my mission. You\\'re my mission! Then finish it. Because I\\'m with you to the end of the line. On your left. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do. Why haven\\'t we yet heard from Captain Rogers? I don\\'t know what there is left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently. Well, he could explain how this country is expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus. HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence. Many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling. Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary. Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill. You\\'re not going to put me in a prison. You\\'re not going to put any of us in a prison. You know why? Do enlighten us. Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we help make it that way. But we\\'re also the ones best qualified to defend it. So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You\\'ll know where to find me. So, you\\'ve experienced this sort of thing before. You get used to it. We\\'ve been data mining HYDRA\\'S files. Looks like a lot of rats didn\\'t go down with the ship. I\\'m headed to Europe tonight. Wanted to ask if you\\'d come. There\\'s something I got to do first. How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities. I\\'m more of a soldier than a spy. All right, then. Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me, right here. You should be honored. That\\'s about as close as he gets to saying thank you. Not going with him? No. - Not staying here. - Nah. I blew all my covers. I got to go figure out a new one. That might take a while. I\\'m counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev. Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse. She\\'s not a nurse. And you\\'re not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. - What was her name again? - Sharon. She\\'s nice. Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread. You\\'re going after him. You don\\'t have to come with me. I know. When do we start? It\\'s over. Fury has released everything to the public. Everything he knows about. Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA... HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D. Two sides of a coin that\\'s no longer currency. What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We\\'ve only scratched the surface and already, there are other facilities doing HYDRA\\'S good work around the world. We\\'ll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends, and keep them off our scent. What about the volunteers? The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won\\'t be able to find them. And the survivors? The twins. Sooner or later, they will meet the twins. It\\'s not a world of spies anymore. Not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, Doctor. There\\'s nothing more horrifying than a miracle. Master Kaecilius. That ritual will bring you only sorrow. Hypocrite! Challenge round, Billy. Oh, come on, Billy, you\\'ve got to be messing with me. No, doctor. Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977. Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard. - Ha! It\\'s 1978. - No, Billy. While Feels So Good may have charted in 1978... the album was released in December of 1977. No. Wikipedia says it\\'s a nineteen... Check again. Where do you store all this useless information? Useless? The man charted a top 10 hit with a flugelhorn. Status, Billy? 1977. - Oh, please. - I hate you. Oh! Feels so good, doesn\\'t it? Oh, I got this, Stephen. You\\'ve done your bit. Go ahead. We\\'ll close up. What is it? GSW. It\\'s amazing you kept him alive. Apneic, failed the brain stem test... and the apnea reflex test. I think I found the problem, Doctor Palmer. You left a bullet in his head. Thanks. It\\'s impinging on the medulla. I needed a specialist. Nic diagnosed brain death. Something about that doesn\\'t feel right to me. We have to run. Doctor West. What are you doing? Hey. Organ harvest. He\\'s a donor. Slow down. I did not agree to that. I don\\'t need you to. We\\'ve already called brain death. Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy. Not gonna let you operate on a dead man. What do you see? - A bullet? - A perfect bullet. It\\'s been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony. A toxic metal. And that\\'s leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid. Rapid onset central nervous system shutdown. We gotta go. The patient\\'s not dead, but he is dying. Still want to harvest his organs? - I\\'ll assist you. - No. Doctor Palmer will assist me. Thank you. Image guidance, stat. We don\\'t have time for that. You can\\'t do it freehand. I can and I will. This isn\\'t a time for showing off, Strange. How about 10 minutes ago when you called the wrong time of death? Cranial nerves intact. Doctor West, cover your watch. You know, you didn\\'t have to humiliate him in front of everyone. I didn\\'t have to save his patient, either. But I sometimes just can\\'t help myself. Nic is a great doctor. You came to me. Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion. You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one. Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference. I can\\'t work in your butcher shop. Hey! I\\'m fusing transected spinal cords. I\\'m stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system. The work I\\'m doing is gonna save thousands for years to come. In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun. Yeah, you\\'re right. In ER, we\\'re only saving lives. There\\'s no fame, there\\'s no, uh, CNN interviews. I guess I\\'ll just have to stick with Nic. Whoa, wait a minute. You\\'re not... You guys aren\\'t... What? Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust. Explicit, actually. No, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues. Oh, really? I call it the \"Strange Policy.\" Oh, well, good, I\\'m glad something\\'s named after me. I invented a laminectomy procedure. And yet, somehow no one seems to want to call it the \"Strange Technique.\" We invented that technique. Regardless, I\\'m very flattered by your policy. I\\'m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me. Another speaking engagement? So romantic. You used to love coming to those things with me. We had fun together. No! You had fun. They weren\\'t about us, they were about you. Not only about me. Stephen. Everything is about you. Maybe we could hyphenate. Strange-Palmer Technique. Palmer-Strange. Billy. What have you got for me? I\\'ve got a 35-year-old Air Force Colonel... crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor. Mid-thoracic burst fracture. Yeah, well, I could help... but so could 50 other people. Find me something worth my time. I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma. Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not. How about a 22-year-old female... with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia... struck by lightning? Mmm. That does sound interesting. Can you send me the... Got it. Hey. It\\'s okay. It\\'s gonna be okay. What did they do? They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. The golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car. What did they do? 11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments... severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours. Look at these fixators. No one could have done better. I could have done better. No. Give your body time to heal. You\\'ve ruined me. How long until I can take... Doctor Strange. Those tissues are still healing. So, speed it up. Pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery. It\\'s possible. Experimental and expensive, but possible. All I need is possible. Up. Up. Show me your strength. This is useless. It\\'s not useless, man. You can do this. All right, answer me this, bachelor\\'s degree. Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe to do this... and actually recover? One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke his back... paralyzed, his leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder, from the wheelchair. He came in three times a week. Then one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street. - Walked? - Yeah, walked. Bullshit. Show me his file. It\\'ll take me a while to pull the files from the archive. But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong... Worth it. I looked at all your research... I read all the papers you\\'ve sent. It\\'s not gonna work. I don\\'t think you realize... - how severe the damages are. - Here\\'s the thing... The best have tried and failed. I understand. Here\\'s the thing. What you want from me is impossible, Stephen. Come on. I\\'ve got my own reputation to consider. - Etienne, wait. No. - I can\\'t help you. No, no, wait! Hey! He won\\'t do it. He\\'s a hack. There is a new procedure in Tokyo. They culture donor stem cells... and then harvesting them and then 3D printing a scaffold. If I could get a loan together... Stephen. A small loan, just $200,000. You\\'ve always spent money as fast as you could make it... but now you\\'re spending money you don\\'t even have. Maybe it\\'s time to consider stopping. No, now is exactly the time not to stop... because, you see, I\\'m not getting any better! But this isn\\'t medicine anymore. This is mania. Some things just can\\'t be fixed. - Life without my work... - ls still life. This isn\\'t the end. There are other things that can give your life meaning. Like what? Like you? This is the part where you apologize. This is the part where you leave. Fine, I can\\'t watch you do this to yourself anymore. Oh, too difficult for you, is it? Yes, it is. It breaks my heart to see you this way. - No, don\\'t pity me. - I\\'m not pitying you. Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing here... bringing cheese and wine like we\\'re old friends going for a picnic? We are not friends, Christine. We were barely lovers. But you just love a sob story, don\\'t you? Is that what I am to you now? \"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.\" \"He finally needs me.\" Another dreg of humanity for you to work on. Patch him up and send him back into the world... heart\\'s just humming. You care so much, don\\'t you? Goodbye, Stephen. All the way. Here we go. Let\\'s go! All day! All day! Yeah! All day. Come on, man! Where\\'s the competition? Talk a lot. Jonathan Pangborn... C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete. Who are you? Paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Partial paralysis in both hands. - I don\\'t know you. - I\\'m Stephen Strange. I\\'m a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon. Actually, you know what, man, I do know you. I came to your office once. You refused to see me. I never got past your assistant. You were untreatable. No glory for you in that, right? You came back from a place there\\'s no way back from. I\\'m trying to find my own way back. Pangborn, are you in or you out? All right. I\\'d given up on my body. I thought my mind\\'s the only thing I have left... I should at least try to elevate that. So, I sat with gurus... and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men. And finally... I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated... and my spirit deepened. And somehow... Your body healed. Yes. There were deeper secrets to learn there... but I didn\\'t have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle and I came back home. The place you\\'re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost there is high. How much? I\\'m not talking about money. Good luck. Let\\'s ball. All right, ball up! Uh, Kamar-Taj? You know where Kamar-Taj is? Kamar-Taj? Kamar-Taj. Okay. Look, guys, I don\\'t have any money. Your watch. No, please. It\\'s all I have left. Your watch. All right. You\\'re looking for Kamar-Taj. Really? Sure we got the right place? That one looks a little more Kamar-Tajey. I once stood in your place. And I, too, was disrespectful. So, might I offer you some advice? Forget everything you think you know. All right. The sanctuary of our teacher. The Ancient One. The Ancient One? What\\'s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. Sorry. Um, thank you for... Whoa! Okay, that\\'s a thing. Thank you for... Hello. Oh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you... Ancient One, for seeing me. You\\'re very welcome. The Ancient One. Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir. Mr. Strange. Uh... Doctor, actually. Well, no, not anymore, surely. Isn\\'t that why you\\'re here? You\\'ve undergone many procedures. - Seven, right? - Yeah. It\\'s good tea. Yes. Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man? In a way. You helped him to walk again. Yes. How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury? Well, I didn\\'t correct it. He couldn\\'t walk. I convinced him that he could. You\\'re not suggesting it was psychosomatic? When you reattach a severed nerve... is it you who heals it back together or the body? It\\'s the cells. The cells are only programmed... to put themselves back together in very specific ways. Right. What if I told you that your own body could be convinced... to put itself back together in all sorts of ways? You\\'re talking about cellular regeneration. That\\'s bleeding edge medical tech. Is that why you\\'re working here? Without a governing medical board? Just how experimental is your treatment? Quite. So, you\\'ve figured out a way... to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal? No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit... to better heal the body. - The spirit to heal the body? - That\\'s right. No. All right. How do we do that? Where do we start? - Don\\'t like that map? - Oh, no. It\\'s really good. It\\'s just, I\\'ve seen it before... in gift shops. And what about this one? - Acupuncture, great. - Yeah? What about that one? Showing me an MRI scan. I do not believe this. Each of those maps was drawn up by someone... who could see in part, but not the whole. I spent my last dollar getting here, one-way ticket... and you\\'re talking to me about healing through belief? You\\'re a man looking at the world through a keyhole. You\\'ve spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole... to see more, to know more. Now, on hearing that it can be widened... in ways you can\\'t imagine... you reject the possibility. No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales... about chakras or energy... or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter and nothing more. You\\'re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe. You think too little of yourself. Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don\\'t. But I see through you! What did you just do to me? I pushed your astral form out of your physical form. What\\'s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD? It\\'s just tea... with a little honey. What just happened? For a moment, you entered the astral dimension. The what? A place where the soul exists apart from the body. Why are you doing this to me? To show you just how much you don\\'t know. Open your eye. Oh, shit! Oh, God! Oh, God, no! No, no, no! What\\'s happening? This isn\\'t real! His heart rate is getting dangerously high. He looks all right to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence... mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. On! This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life giving. Others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places... where powers older than time lie ravenous... and waiting. Who are you in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop? Teach me. No. No. No! No, no, no! No! Open the door! Please! Thank you, Masters. You think I was wrong to cast him out? 5 hours later, he\\'s still on your doorstep. There\\'s a strength to him. Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition. I\\'ve seen it all before. He reminds you of Kaecilius? I cannot lead another gifted student to power... only to lose him to the darkness. You didn\\'t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law. We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them. Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin... upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange. Don\\'t shut me out. I haven\\'t got anywhere else to go. Thank you. Bathe. Rest. Meditate... if you can. The Ancient One will send for you. What\\'s this\\'? My mantra? The Wi-Fi password. We\\'re not savages. The language of the mystic arts... is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity... called the use of this language \"spells.\" But if that word offends your modern sensibilities... you can call it a \"program.\" The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy... drawn from other dimensions of the Multiverse... to cast spells... to conjure shields... and weapons... to make magic. But even if my fingers could do that... my hands would just be waving in the air. How do I get from here to there? How did you get to reattach severed nerves... and put a human spine back together bone by bone? Study and practice, years of it. Hey. Mr. Strange. Uh, Stephen, please. - And you are? - Wong. Wong. Just Wong? Like Adele? Or Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem. The Book of the Invisible Sun. Astronomia Nova. Codex Imperium. Key of Solomon. You finished all of these? Yup. Come with me. All right. This section is for masters only... but at my discretion, others may use it. You should start with Maxim\\'s Primer. How\\'s your Sanskrit? I\\'m fluent in Google Translate. Vedic, classical Sanskrit. What are those? The Ancient One\\'s private collection. So, they\\'re forbidden? No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme. This one\\'s got pages missing. That\\'s The Book of Cagliostro. A study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former master. The Zealot, Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian... and relieved him of his head. I am now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again... I\\'d know it... and you\\'d be dead before you ever left the compound. What if it\\'s just overdue? Any late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps? People used to think that I was funny. Did they work for you? All right. Well, it\\'s been lovely talking to you. Thank you for the books... and for the horrifying story... and for the threat upon my life. We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world. Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the Multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker and easier... the gateway will come. And stop. I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange. Of course. My hands. It\\'s not about your hands. How is this not about my hands? Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current... and use its power as your own. I control it by surrendering control? That doesn\\'t make any sense. Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life... but it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego... and your power will rise. Come with me. Wait. - Is this... - Everest. Beautiful. Yeah, right, beautiful. Freezing but beautiful. At this temperature... a person can last for 30 minutes... before suffering permanent loss of function. Great. But you\\'ll likely go into shock within the first two. - What? - Surrender, Stephen. No! How\\'s our new recruit? We shall see. Any second now. Oh, no, not again. Maybe I should... Stephen. Wong. What do you want, Strange? Books on astral projection. You\\'re not ready for that. Try me, Beyoncé. Oh, come on. You\\'ve heard of her. She\\'s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh, come on,  just give me the book. No. Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now, I\\'m told you question every lesson... preferring to teach yourself. Once, in this room, you told me to open my eye. Now, I\\'m being told to blindly accept rules... that make no sense. Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library? Wong told on me? You\\'re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension... ever present but undetected. The real world isn\\'t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil... and sometimes to contain threats. You don\\'t wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring. Hold on. Sorry. What do you mean, \"threats?\" Learning of an infinite Multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers. If I told you everything else that you don\\'t already know... you\\'d run from here in terror. So just how ancient is she? No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she\\'s Celtic and never talks about her past. You follow her, even though you don\\'t know? I know she\\'s steadfast... but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher... and don\\'t lose your way. Like Kaecilius? That\\'s right. You knew him. When he first came to us... he\\'d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving, broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. He questioned the Ancient One, rejected her teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep. Seduced by false doctrine. And he stole the forbidden ritual, right? Yes. What did it do? No more questions. What\\'s that? That\\'s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain... so we imbue objects with it... allowing them to take the strain we cannot. This is the staff... of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics. The Wand of Watoomb. The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr. Really just roll off the tongue, don\\'t they? - When do I get my relic? - When you\\'re ready. I think I\\'m ready. You\\'re ready when the relic decides you\\'re ready. For now... conjure a weapon. All right. Fight! Fight like your life depended on it. Because one day... it may. Wong? Okay. \"First, open the Eye of Agamotto.\" All right. Oh, my. What if... \"Dormammu.\" \"The Dark Dimension.\" Eternal life? - What the... - Stop! Tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden. I was just doing exactly what it said in the book. What did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual? I don\\'t know. I hadn\\'t gotten to that part yet. Temporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings. Spatial paradoxes! Time loops! You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over and over forever... or never having existed at all? Really should put the warnings before the spell. Your curiosity could have gotten you killed. You weren\\'t manipulating the space-time continuum... you were breaking it. We do not tamper with natural law. We defend it. How did you even do that? Hmm? Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it? I\\'ve got a photographic memory. That\\'s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time. What you just did... takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts. And yet my hands still shake. For now, yes. Not forever? We\\'re not prophets. When are you gonna start telling me what we are? While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers... we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats. The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme... going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts... the mighty Agamotto. Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed. Agamotto built three Sanctums in places of power... where great cities now stand. That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum. That door to the New York Sanctum. That one to the London Sanctum. Together... the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world. The Sanctums protect the world... and we sorcerers... protect the Sanctums. From what? Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe. Like Dormammu. Where did you learn that name? I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why? Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension. Beyond time. He is the cosmic conqueror... the destroyer of worlds. A being of infinite power and endless hunger... on a quest to invade every universe... and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension. And he hungers for Earth most of all. The pages that Kaecilius stole. A ritual to contact Dormammu and draw power from the Dark Dimension. Uh... Okay... Um... I\\'m out. I came here to heal my hands. Not to fight in some mystical war. London. Kaecilius! No! Wong? Mordo? Hello? Hello? Daniel, I see they made you master of this Sanctum. You know what that means? That you\\'ll die protecting it. Stop! How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister... Doctor. Mister Doctor? It\\'s Strange. Maybe. Who am I to judge? Ha! You don\\'t know how to use that, do you? Uh... What? Oh, stop it. I said stop it. You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor. I don\\'t even know what \"this\" is. It\\'s the end... and the beginning. The many becoming the few becoming the One. If you\\'re not gonna start making sense... I\\'m just gonna to have to put this thing back on. Tell me, Mister Doctor... My name is Doctor Stephen Strange. - You are a doctor? - Yeah. A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out. Our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension... it\\'s a place beyond time. That\\'s it. I\\'m putting this thing back on. This world doesn\\'t have to die, doctor. This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others... as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. We can all live forever. Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia? The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil... when really time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything. What about the people you killed? Tiny- Momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see. You see what we\\'re doing. The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal... for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor... we don\\'t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it... to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution... the why of all existence. The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence. What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all. Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed... and instead The Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. You ever wonder how she managed to live this long? I saw the rituals in The Book of Cagliostro. So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow The Ancient One... and tear her Sanctums down. To let the Dark Dimension in. Because what The Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely. Life everlasting. He\\'s not the destroyer of worlds, doctor. He\\'s the savior of worlds. No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that\\'s funny? No, not that. What\\'s funny is that you\\'ve lost your sling ring. Sir, can I help you? Doctor Palmer, where is she? - Sir. We need to get... - Where is she? The nurse\\'s station. Christine! Stephen? Oh, my God. Get me in an operating theater now. Just you. Now! I haven\\'t any time. What happened? I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade. What are you wearing? Chest cavity is clear. No, the blood is in the pericardial sac. No, no, no. Stephen? Come on, come on. Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle. Stephen? What am I seeing? My astral body. Are you dead? No, Christine. But I am dying. Right. Yeah. All right. Okay. Oh, wow. I\\'ve never seen a wound like this. What were you stabbed with? I don\\'t know. I\\'m gonna have to vanish now. What? Keep me alive, will you? Huh? Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, shit. Come on, come on. Stephen, come on. Hit me again. Stop doing that! Up the voltage and hit me again. No, your heart\\'s beating! Just do it! Oh, my God. Oh, God! Oh, God! Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. After all this time... you just show up here... flying out of your body. Yeah, I know. I missed you, too, by the way. Ha ha. I wrote you emails, but you never responded. Why would I? Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. You were right. I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly. And you deserved so much more. Stop. You\\'re clearly in shock. What the hell is happening? Where have you been? Well, after Western medicine failed me... I headed east, and I ended up in Kathmandu. Kathmandu? Yeah. Like the Bob Seger song? 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah. I went to a place called Kamar-Taj... and I talked to someone called \"The Ancient One.\" Oh. So you joined a cult. No, I didn\\'t. No, not exactly. No. They did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed. Yeah. That sounds like a cult. It\\'s not a cult. Well, that\\'s what a cultist would say. Oh, no. Wait. Stephen, wait. What do you think you\\'re doing? I\\'m late for a cult meeting. This is insane. Yeah. - Where are you going? - Um... Can you tell me the truth? Well, a powerful sorcerer who gave himself over to an ancient entity... can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me. But I left him chained up in Greenwich Village... and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway... that I opened up in the mop closet. Okay. Don\\'t tell me. Fine. Really do have to go. Yeah. Strange! You\\'re okay. A relative term. But yeah, I\\'m okay. The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you. No minor feat. It\\'s a fickle thing. - He\\'s escaped. - Kaecilius? Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will. He folds matter outside the Mirror Dimension... in the real world? Yeah. - How many more? - Two. I stranded one in the desert. And the other? His body\\'s in the hall. Master Drumm is in the foyer. He\\'s been taken back to Kamar-Taj. The London Sanctum has fallen. Only New York and Hong Kong remain now... to shield us from the Dark Dimension. You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its master gone, it needs another. Master Strange. No. It is Doctor Strange. Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange. Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I\\'m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them. You became a doctor to save one life above all others. Your own. Still seeing through me, are you? Your over-inflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything... even death... which no one can control. Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange. Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality. It\\'s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it. Like you feed off him? You talk to me about controlling death? Oh, I know how you do it. I\\'ve seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro. Measure your next words very carefully, doctor. Because you might not like them? Because you may not know of what you speak. What is he talking about? I\\'m talking about her long life, the source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive. That\\'s not true. I\\'ve seen the rituals. Worked them out. I know how you do it. Once they regroup... the Zealots will be back. You\\'ll need reinforcements. She\\'s not who you think she is. You don\\'t have the right to say that. You\\'ve no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders. No, and I don\\'t want to know. You\\'re a coward. Because I\\'m not a killer? These Zealots will snuff us all out... and you can\\'t muster the strength to snuff them first? What do you think I just did? You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog. Oh, you would have done it so easily? You\\'ve no idea the things I\\'ve done. And the answer is yes. Without hesitation. Even if there\\'s another way? There is no other way. You lack imagination. No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They\\'re back. We have to end this. NOW! Strange! Get down here and fight! No! The Mirror Dimension. You can\\'t affect the real world in here. Who\\'s laughing now? Asshole. I am. I\\'ve got his sling ring. They can\\'t escape, right? Run! Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can\\'t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn\\'t cleverness. It was suicide! That is hilarious. This was a mistake. Whoa. Oh! It\\'s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius. I came to you broken... lost, in need. Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies. I tried to protect you. - From the truth? - From yourself. I have a new teacher now. Dormammu deceives you. You have no idea what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment. Liar. Christine! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. It\\'s not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium. - Neurogenic? - Yes. Someone get the swabs. Nic? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain. She\\'s still dropping. We\\'re losing her! We need to increase her oxygen! I need a crash cart! Her pupils have dilated! No reflexes. We\\'re not reading any brain activity. What are you doing\\'? Come on, you\\'re dying! You have to return to your body now. You don\\'t have time. Time is relative. Your body hasn\\'t even hit the floor yet. I\\'ve spent so many years... peering through time... looking at this exact moment. But I can\\'t see past it. I\\'ve prevented countless, terrible futures. And after each one, there\\'s always another. And they all lead here... but never further. You think this is where you die. You wonder what I see in your future? No. Yes. I never saw your future. Only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled... but not because you craved success... but because of your fear of failure. That\\'s what made me a great doctor. It\\'s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you... from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all. Which is? It\\'s not about you. When you first came to me... you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn\\'t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body. He uses magic to walk? Constantly. He had a choice... to return to his own life... or to serve something greater than himself. So I could have my hands back again? My Old life? You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I\\'ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension. But as you well know... sometimes one must break the rules... in order to serve the greater good. Mordo won\\'t see it that way. Mordo\\'s soul is rigid and unmovable... forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility... just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu. I\\'m not ready. No one ever is. We don\\'t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered. Your time is short. You\\'d think after all this time, I\\'d be ready. But look at me. Stretching one moment out into a thousand... just so that I can watch the snow. Are you okay? I don\\'t understand what\\'s happening. I know. But I have to go away now. You said that losing my hands didn\\'t have to be the end. That it could be a beginning. Yeah. Because there are other ways to save lives. A harder way. A weirder way. Doctor Palmer to the ER, please. Doctor Palmer to the ER. I don\\'t want you to go. Stop! Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius. You\\'re on the wrong side of history, Wong. She\\'s dead. You were right. She wasn\\'t who I thought she was. She was complicated. Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile. Dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden... while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life. She did what she thought was right. The bill comes due. Don\\'t you see? Her transgressions led the Zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault! And here we are... in the consequence of her deception. A world on fire. Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen. The New York one has been attacked twice. You know where they\\'re going next. Hong Kong. You told me once to fight like my life depended on it... because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I cannot defeat them alone. The Sanctum\\'s already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It\\'s too late. Nothing can stop him. Not necessarily. No. The spell\\'s working. We\\'ve got a second chance. Whoa! No! Wong. Breaking the laws of nature. I know. Well, don\\'t stop now. When the Sanctum\\'s restored, they\\'ll attack it again. We\\'ve got to defend it. Come on! Get up, Strange. Get up and fight. We can finish this. You can\\'t fight the inevitable. Isn\\'t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. - Beyond time... - Strange. He\\'s gone. Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power. Dormammu, I\\'ve come to bargain. You\\'ve come to die. Your world is now my world... like all worlds. Dormammu, I\\'ve come to bargain. You\\'ve come to die. Your world is now my... What is this? Illusion? No. This is real. Good. Dormammu, I\\'ve come to bargain. You\\'ve... What is happening? Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension... I brought a little power from mine. This is time. Endless looped time. You dare! Oh... Dormammu, I\\'ve come to bargain. You cannot do this forever. Actually, I can. This is how things are now. You and me, trapped in this moment... endlessly. Then you will spend eternity dying. Yes. But everyone on Earth will live. But you will suffer. Pain\\'s an old friend. Dormammu... I\\'ve come to bargain. End this! Dormammu... Dormammu... Dormammu... You will never win. No... but I can lose... again and again... and again... and again, forever. And that makes you my prisoner. No! Stop! Make this stop! Set me free! No. I\\'ve come to bargain. What do you want? Take your Zealots from the Earth. End your assault on my world. Never come back. Do it... and I\\'ll break the loop. Get up, Strange! Get up and fight. We can finish this. Isn\\'t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. What have you done? I made a bargain. What is this? Well, it\\'s everything you\\'ve ever wanted. Eternal life as part of the One. You\\'re not gonna like it. Yeah, you know, you really should have stolen the whole book because the warnings... The warnings come after the spells. Oh, that\\'s funny. We did it. Yes. Yes, we did it. By also violating... the natural law. Look around you. It\\'s over. You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always! A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer. Yeah, okay. Wise choice. You\\'ll wear the Eye of Agamotto... once you\\'ve mastered its powers. Until then... best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone. A what? You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One\\'s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready. We\\'ll be ready. THOR\". So Earth has wizards now, huh? Tea? I don\\'t drink tea. What do you drink? Not tea. So, I keep a watch list... of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings. Worthy inclusion. Yeah. So why bring him here to New York? It\\'s a bit of a long story. Family drama, that kind of thing. But we\\'re looking for my father. Oh, okay. So if you found Odin... you\\'d all return to Asgard promptly? Oh, yes. Promptly. Great! Allow me to help you. Can I help you? They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a stretcher. Look at you now, Pangborn. Mordo. So what can I do for you, man? I\\'ve been away for many months now, and I\\'ve had a revelation. The true purpose of a sorcerer... is to twist things out of their proper shape... stealing power... perverting nature. Like you. I\\'ve stolen nothing. This is my power. - Mine. - Power... has a purpose. Why are you doing this? Because I see, at long last, what\\'s wrong with the world. Too many sorcerers. Is it ready? (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) Hey!

Have our people look for a white man at the bottling plant. Tell them no contact! If he even sees them, he\\'s gone! I got you who I could. Short notice, but they\\'re all quality.

He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists, a military officer, an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters. So don\\'t wait to see if he\\'s a fighter!

But see if he\\'s been talking to anybody. Forgive me, sir? Doesn\\'t anybody want to talk about what went down in there? \\'Cause... He didn\\'t lose us. And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

Well, if Banner knows what it is, I\\'m gonna track him down, I\\'m gonna put my foot on his throat - and I\\'m gonna... - That was Banner. It was Banner. - You have to explain that statement, sir. - No, I don\\'t. You\\'ve done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We\\'re going home. Wait. Please. (IN ENGLISH) Where am I? BLONSKY: I\\'ve run into bad situations on crap missions before. I\\'ve seen good men go down purely because someone didn\\'t let us know what we were walking into. I\\'ve moved on to the next one, because that\\'s what we do, right? I mean, that\\'s the job. But this? This is a whole new level of weird. And I don\\'t feel inclined to step away from it. So if you\\'re taking another crack at him, I want in. And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that\\'s prepped and ready to fight, because if that thing shows up again, you\\'re gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants. Sir. (HENS CLUCKING) (DOG BARKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (COINS CLINKING) (CHATTERING IN SPANISH) Tienes m��s stretchy? Yeah. Perfecto. (MOTORCYCLE PASSING) Let me emphasise that what I\\'m about to share with you is tremendously sensitive, both to me personally and the Army. You\\'re aware that we\\'ve got an Infantry Weapons Development programme. Well, in WWll, they initiated a subprogram for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement. Yeah, Super Soldier. Yes. An oversimplification, but yes. And I dusted it off, got \\'em doing serious work again, bold work. Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better. We were tryin\\' to make you better. Banner\\'s work was very early phase. It wasn\\'t even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance. I would never have told him what the project really was. But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself. And something went very wrong. Or it went very right. As far as I\\'m concerned, that man\\'s whole body is the property of the US Army. You said he wasn\\'t working on weapons, right? - No. - But you were. You were, weren\\'t you? You were trying other things. One serum we developed was very promising. - So why did he run? - He\\'s a scientist. He is not one of us. - Blonsky, how old are you? 45? - 39. - It takes a toll, doesn\\'t it? - Yes, it does. So get out of the trenches. You should be a Colonel by now, with your record. No, I\\'m a fighter. I\\'ll be one for as long as I can. You know, if I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had ten years ago, that would be someone I wouldn\\'t want to fight. I could probably arrange something like that. Take care, kids. Stan, I give you my word, whatever you\\'ve heard about me, it\\'s not true. Oh, I know it. I always knew it. I mean, you know how I felt about you two. - Have you talked to her? - No. She doesn\\'t know that I\\'m here. - She\\'s with somebody? - Yeah, he\\'s a head shrink. They say he\\'s one of the best. But a really nice guy. Good. That\\'s good. - Bruce, what can I do to help you? - I could use a bed for a few nights. - You can have the spare room upstairs. - That\\'d be so great. There is one other thing. Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through. Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five. I don\\'t think there\\'s anybody up there. Oh, man. I\\'m gonna catch hell if I don\\'t collect. You got to let me try. I\\'ll tell you what. I got an extra medium. Take it on the house. - You are the man. - God bless you, brother. All right. (COMPUTERS BLEEPING) Okay. We\\'re pretty well closed here, folks. I\\'m sorry. Oh, come on, Stan. It\\'s Friday night. Oh, kids. I got nothing but marinara now. Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please. She worked through dinner again, of course. Stan? And he... I go, \"So, yeah, I mean, where were you? \"I can\\'t... I don\\'t know where you were, Cecil.\" And he goes, \"Not where you been at.\" I thought, \"Oh, my God.\" I just felt so awful. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Bruce? Betty? What\\'s going on? Betty... Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw. - I don\\'t know what to say. - Please, just tell me the truth. BETTY: Don\\'t go. Don\\'t go. I want you to come with me now. Please. Come with me. Please. BETTY: It\\'s our data. I got in there before they carted it all away. I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday. - Does the General know that you have this? - No, I don\\'t think so. I haven\\'t spoken to him in a couple of years. You have to be sure. Bruce, I don\\'t understand why we can\\'t just go in there together and talk to him. He told me what he wanted to do. He wants it out of me. He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it. He wants to make it a weapon. - Hi. - Hi. - I thought you might want to... - Thanks. Listen, I should leave early, as early as I can. Really? You can\\'t stay at all? I want to, but it\\'s just not safe for me to be here. - Lf I could borrow some cash... - Of course. I need to take a bus. Well, at least let me walk you to the station. Okay. - You have everything you need? - Yeah. I... What? - Good night. - Good night. I hope you get some rest. We\\'re giving you a very low dose only. I need you sharp out there and disciplined. First sign of any side effect, we stop and you\\'re off team until you straighten out. - Agreed? - Agreed. You\\'ll get two separate infusions. One into the deep muscle, one into the bone marrow centres. The bone ones are going to hurt. (GRUNTS) Is everything okay? I think so. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Come here. - I just wanna do this. - Oh. - It\\'s better like that. - Yeah? It feels too tight, huh? - Yeah, a little. - Okay. - What? - They\\'re here. - Betty, look at me, look at me! - Bruce! You have to go far away from me as you can! - Don\\'t argue with me, just go. Go! - Bruce! (CAR ALARM SOUNDING) Damn it! We\\'d have had snipers on target in three more minutes. I wanna know who jumped the gun. He\\'s heading 2-7-0. Blonsky! Not yet! Sir. Look alive. This could get interesting. I got him! Stop! Stop! I know you\\'re in there! General, please! Sir? Dad! - Dad, please don\\'t do this. - You can\\'t see this clearly. Now, get inside. There he is! SOLDIER 1 ON RADIO: Target is in the overpass. We have a visual. Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage! SOLDIER 2: He\\'s locked in. Put two canisters in there with him. SOLDIER: Fire! Get her back here! (GRUNTING) Now she\\'ll see. (ROARING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) Alpha team? Let him have all of it. SOLDIER 2: Come on, light him up! Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses! (GRUNTING) Oh, my God! Blonsky, now you\\'re up! Sir? Cover me. (GROWLING) Remember me? My God, he\\'s doing it. Move him toward the cannons! SOLDIER: Move! (GROWLS) Hold your position! BLONSKY: Do it now! (HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING) (GRUNTING) Please, please, please, no! - Please, please, please! - Get her back! You\\'re killing him! BETTY: Stop! Get off of me! (DISTORTED) Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Where\\'s the gunship? Is that it? Blonsky, pull back now. Pull back! Is that all you got? (GROWLS) - Fall back! - SOLDIER 3: Fall back! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go! GENERAL: Find cover! Betty! Fire, goddamn it! Bruce? (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) Stop firing! No! (GROWLS) You did the right thing, calling us. I need to know where they\\'re going. She\\'ll be in incredible danger as long as she\\'s with him. From who? He protected her. You almost killed her. I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point. You know, it\\'s a point of professional pride with me that I can always tell when somebody\\'s lying. And you are. I don\\'t know where he\\'s going. - I know she\\'ll help him, if she can. - Then she\\'s aiding a fugitive. And I can\\'t help either one of them. I used to wonder why she never talked about you. Now I know! GENERAL: Where does she meet these guys? (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Bruce? Bruce. (ROARING) It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. Come here. Come this way. Watch your head. Okay. We\\'re okay. It\\'s okay. It\\'s just the rain. GENERAL: Will he ever walk again? DOCTOR: Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now. I will say this for him. He\\'s got a heart like a machine. Never seen anything like it, outside of a racehorse. Here. Okay. (GASPS) (PANTING) (BRUCE VOMITING) Bruce? Oh, hi. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better. - Good. - I just had to get my data back. You ate it? Well, you know, the circumstances called for a little improvisation. Wow. Okay, so they didn\\'t have a great selection, but I got you some options. First thing\\'s first. Oh, you\\'re kidding me. What? - No. - They were the stretchiest pair they had. I\\'ll take my chances. FEMALE REPORTER: Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary on the campus of Culver University earlier today. Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle. JIM: It was so big. - It was like this huge, like, hulk! - Yeah. FEMALE REPORTER: McGhee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper, captured this on his cell phone. Further search for the mysterious \"hulk\" was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest. Not too short back there. I have done this before, you know. I don\\'t know how you\\'ve done this on your own for all this time. With clippers, usually. (BETTY CHUCKLING) (WATCH BEEPING) (WATCH BEEPING RAPIDLY) - Wait, wait, wait. Wait. - What? What? We can\\'t do this. - It\\'s okay. I want to. - No. No. I can\\'t. (BEEPING SLOWS) I can\\'t get too excited. (BEEPING STOPS) Not even a little excited? (BRUCE SIGHS) BETTY: It\\'s okay. Sir, it\\'s Blonsky. Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family? Ask him yourself. Sir? - Good to see you back on your feet, soldier. - Thank you, sir. How do you feel? Pissed off and ready for round three. Basically, we can\\'t use any of this, because they can track all of it. Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that? - No. You can take your lip gloss. - Thank you. - Well, I need my glasses. - Well, you can take - your glasses and your watch, okay? - Okay. We can use most of it. We just can\\'t use the credit cards, the ID or the phone. - Don\\'t even turn that on. - Okay. And we\\'ll take the cash, obviously. How will we get where we need to go on $40 and no credit cards? Well, we could sell this. No. No, that\\'s the only thing you have left from her. No. Well, we\\'ll have to try and get it back. SPARR: Federal is already monitoring phones, plastic and Dr Ross\\'s web accounts, and local PD have been placed on alert. They\\'ll pop up somewhere and when they do, it comes straight to us. GENERAL: They\\'re not gonna just pop up. He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes. He\\'s not gonna use a damn credit card now. If he was trying to escape, he\\'d be long gone. He\\'s not trying to escape this time. He\\'s looking for help and that\\'s how we\\'re gonna get him. We know what they\\'re after and we know he\\'s been talking to somebody. You all have copies of the correspondence. The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue have been added to the SHIELD Operations Database. If he comes up for air, we\\'ll be waiting. If he makes a peep, we\\'ll hear him. And when he slips up, we\\'ll be ready. Hey. Smile. What is it like? When it happens, what do you experience? Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? Those induced hallucinations? It\\'s a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified. It\\'s like someone\\'s poured a litre of acid into my brain. - Do you remember anything? - Just fragments. Images. There\\'s too much noise. I can never derive anything out of it. - But then it\\'s still you inside it. - No. No, it\\'s not. I don\\'t know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there, it\\'s just overcharged and can\\'t process what\\'s happening. I don\\'t want to control it. I want to get rid of it. Are you ready? Let\\'s even the playing field a little. Gentlemen. (HORN BLARING) BETTY: Bruce, wake up. There\\'s something going on. We got to go. Walk toward the back. Just don\\'t move too fast. All right. Come. BETTY: It is a long way uptown. I think the subway\\'s probably quickest. Me in a metal tube, deep underground, with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world? Right. Let\\'s get a cab. CAB DRIVER: Come on, now! Let\\'s go! You\\'re too slow! You drive like a woman! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) - Very nice. You see her? - Oh, my. Very pretty. Watch out, you goat! Breathe, breathe, breathe. Are you out of your mind? - What is wrong with you? - What\\'s the matter, baby? You don\\'t like a good ride? (GRUNTING) Asshole! (BETTY GRUNTS) You know, I know a few techniques could help you - manage that anger very effectively. - You zip it. We\\'re walking. Okay. Excuse me. Dr Sterns? - Yes. - I\\'m sorry to bother you. I\\'m Elizabeth Ross. Oh! Dr Ross! - I have someone who\\'d like to meet you. - Okay. It\\'s Mr Blue, isn\\'t it? Mr Green? I got to tell you, I\\'ve been wondering if you were even real. And if you were, what would it look like? A person with that much power lurking in him. Nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming man shaking my hand. But, look. We\\'re not strolling into the park for a picnic, here. Even if everything goes perfectly, if we induce an episode, if we get the dosage exactly right, is that going to be a lasting cure or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up? I don\\'t know. What I\\'m saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer we\\'re dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity. - You mean it could kill him. - Kill him? Yeah. I should say so. You should know that there\\'s a flip side to this, too. If we miss on the low side, if we induce me and it fails, this will be very dangerous for you. Look. I\\'ve always been more curious than cautious, and that\\'s served me pretty well. So, are we going to do this? How you feeling, man? Like a monster. Okay. On the table. These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction. You can tell me later if you thought it was strong. Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students. Okay... You, you, you. This will be a somewhat novel sensation. (MACHINE STARTING UP) We have begun. The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood. Except the antidote will only take hold once we\\'ve achieved a full reaction. Just relax. Okay. We are comprehensive. Here you go. All right. We set to pop? I\\'d take your hands off him. (GRUNTING) Oh, my God! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Wait, wait! There\\'s more! Wait! - Now. Okay, now! - STERNS: Wait. Now, do it! Do it! Bruce! Bruce, look at me. Stay with me. The antidote, now! Sterns, do it now! Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes. Please, look in my eyes. (MACHINE BEEPING) Oh, you\\'ve got to be kidding me! (HULK GROANING) Bruce. Oh, my God. Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me? Bruce? (GASPS) It\\'s okay. You\\'re okay. You\\'re okay. You did it. He\\'s fine. This is fantastic. BETTY: It\\'s over. Hi. Hi. That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life! Okay, you know what? Stop, please. We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there. Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse came from the amygdala. - I think Dr Ross\\'s primer... - Are you okay? ...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily, and then it abates. That\\'s why you didn\\'t die of radiation sickness years ago! Now, maybe we\\'ve neutralised those cells permanently, or maybe we just suppressed that event. I\\'m inclined to think the latter, but it\\'s hard to know because none of our test subjects ever survived. - Of course, they weren\\'t getting the primer! - Wait, wait. - Wait, what did you just say? - They weren\\'t getting - the myostatin primer... - No, no, no. Test subjects? What test subjects? Come with me. - SPARR: What\\'s the activity level? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector. STERNS ON RADIO: We started on rats and mice, but it just completely fried them, so we had to go bigger. And we still don\\'t know which is more toxic, the gamma or your blood. - What do you mean, my blood? - Bruce, this is all you. You didn\\'t send me much to work with, so I had to concentrate it and make more. With a little more trial and error, there\\'s no end to what we can do! This is potentially Olympian! This gamma technology has limitless applications. We\\'ll unlock hundreds of cures. We will make humans impervious to disease! No, no, we\\'ve got to destroy it. - Wait, what? - All of it. Tonight. We\\'re gonna incinerate it. - Is this the whole supply? - What... We could get the Nobel for this! You don\\'t understand the power of this thing. It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled. At your discretion, shooter. STERNS ON RADIO: Three of us! This is Promethean fire! BRUCE ON RADIO: It\\'s just... SOLDIER ON RADIO: No shot. Blonsky\\'s going in. GENERAL: Blonsky, stand down. My daughter\\'s in there! We have the antidote now. They don\\'t want the antidote! They want to make it a weapon! (SIRENS WAILING) And if we let it go, we will never get it back. You don\\'t know how powerful this thing is. I hate the government just as much as anyone, but you\\'re being a little paranoid, don\\'t you think? (GASPS) Bruce! Bruce! Get out. (BETTY SCREAMS) Where is it? Come on, where is it? (BRUCE EXCLAIMS) (WATCH BEEPING RAPIDLY) Show him to me. Blonsky! (HEART BEATING SLOWLY) SOLDIER: Miss! Take this. If you took it from me, I\\'m gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life. Betty. I will never forgive what you\\'ve done to him. He\\'s a fugitive. You made him a fugitive to cover your failures and to protect your career. Don\\'t ever speak to me as your daughter again. It\\'s only because you\\'re my daughter that you\\'re not in handcuffs, too. SPARR: Are you telling me you can make more like him? No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces, but it\\'s not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty, if that\\'s what you\\'re asking. He was a freak accident! The goal is to do it better! So Banner\\'s the only... - She\\'s an annoying bitch. - Why are you always hitting people? Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression? It\\'s not what you\\'ve done. It\\'s what you\\'re gonna do. I want what you got out of Banner. I want that. You look like you\\'ve got a little something in you already, don\\'t you? I want more. You\\'ve seen what he becomes, right? I have. And it\\'s beautiful. Godlike. Well, I want that. I need that. Make me that. I don\\'t know what you\\'ve got inside you already. The mix could be an abomination. (GASPING) I didn\\'t say I was unwilling. I just need informed consent. And you\\'ve given it. This is what I was trying to explain. I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been ladling into yourself. But clearly it worked. Let\\'s assume you don\\'t understand a word I\\'m saying, but if you\\'ll just get back on the table, I can fix this. (ABOMINATION GROWLING) (ABOMINATION LAUGHING) SOLDIER 1: Shoot it! SOLDIER 2: Hey! No! (SOLDIERS SCREAMING) SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader. They took out two of our guys, two of our guys! Blonsky and the Major are still inside! (ABOMINATION GROWLING) Come on! Move, move, move, move! It\\'s over there! SOLDIER 2: Drop them! SOLDIER 3: What is that thing? SOLDIER 4: Shoot it! (WOMAN SCREAMING) Okay. All right! You... You, drive! Let\\'s go! Move, move! SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader! SOLDIER 6: Go, go, go, go, go! SOLDIER 5: Something big just went off down here! General, you should hear this! The Hulk is in the street! I repeat, the Hulk is in the street! That\\'s impossible. You get a hold of yourself, young man. You get it together. What is your position? 121st Street, heading north on Broadway! Turn us around. We\\'re going back. Why are we going back? Damn it! Give me eyes down there! Yes, sir! What the hell was that? Go, go, go! (SIRENS WAILING) No! (WOMAN SCREAMING) (GROWLING) One of yours? Oh, my God. What have you done? OFFICER: Fire at him, fire at him! Do you think a rifle\\'s gonna hurt that? Come on! Sweet. (ABOMINATION ROARING) Booyah! (LAUGHING) (CAR ALARMS BEEPING) Get out of there, soldier! Stacy! Give me a real fight! Sir? Sir? Tell them to bring everything they\\'ve got and head for Harlem. It has to be me. You have to take me back there. What are you saying? You think you can control it? No, no, not control it, but, I don\\'t know, maybe aim it. And what if you can\\'t? We made this thing. All of us. Please. - Land us near it. - No, no. No, keep us high. Open the back door. Bruce! Bruce, stop! Stop! What are you doing? Think about this! You don\\'t even know if you\\'ll change! You don\\'t have to do this! Please, this is insane! Betty, I\\'ve got to try. I\\'m sorry. Oh, shit! - Get her in here! - Come on, miss. (HULK GROWLING) There. Betty! (PEOPLE CLAMOURING) (ROARING) Hulk! Yeah! (BOTH GROWLING) (ABOMINATION LAUGHING) Come on! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) (ROARING) Is that all you\\'ve got? Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help! Which one? Help the green one, damn it! Which one do you think? Cut the other one in half! Ross! Keep it on him! (HULK AND ABOMINATION GRUNTING) PILOT: Look, I got to put it down! GENERAL: Hang on! (ALARM SOUNDING) (ABOMINATION AND HULK GRUNTING) Dad? (GROANING) Are you hurt? Let me help you. I\\'m all right. Just find a way out. (GROWLING) (CHUCKLING) You don\\'t deserve this power! Now watch her die! (BOTH GRUNTING) Look out! General? Any last words? Hulk smash! (ROARING) BETTY: Stop! (ROARING) It\\'s okay. Betty. (GROWLING) (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) (HEART BEATING) (HEART BEATING RAPIDLY) GENERAL: Reload. Reload. TONY: The smell of stale beer and defeat.
